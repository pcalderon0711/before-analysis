Jesse,  Do you have any idea what they were arguing about?,1
Jesse,Do you do you speak English?,1
Céline,"Yeah. No, I'm sorry, my German is not very good.   Have you ever heard that as couples get older, they lose their ability to hear each other?",1
Jesse,No.,1
Céline,"Well, supposedly, men lose the ability to hear higher-pitched sounds, and women eventually lose hearing in the low end. I guess they sort of nullify each other, or something.",1
Jesse,"I guess. Nature's way of allowing couples to grow old together without killing each other.   What are you reading?   Oh, yeah.",1
Céline,How bout you?,1
Jesse,Umm.,1
Jesse,"Look, I was thinking about going to the lounge car sometime soon. Would you like to come with me?",1
Céline,  Yeah.,1
Jesse,Okay.,1
Jesse,So how do you speak such good English?,2
Céline,I went to school for a summer in Los Angeles.   This fine here?,2
Jesse,"Yeah, this is good.",2
Céline,Then I spent some time in London. How do you speak such good English?,2
Jesse,Me? I'm American.,2
Céline,You're American?,2
Jesse,Yeah.,2
Céline,Are you sure?,2
Jesse,  Yeah.,2
Céline,"  No, I'm joking. I knew you were American. And of course, you don't speak any other language, right?",2
Jesse,  You know,2
Céline,  UN billet.,2
Jesse,"Un. Whatever. Un, Un.   So, where are you headed?",2
Céline,"Well, back to Paris. My classes start next week.",2
Jesse,"Oh, you're still in school? Where do you go?",2
Céline,"Yeah, La Sorbonne, you know?",2
Jesse,"Well, sure.   Hey, you coming from Budapest?",2
Céline,"Yeah, I was visiting my grandmother.",2
Jesse,Oh. How's she?,2
Céline,  She's okay.,2
Jesse,She's alright?,2
Céline,"She's fine, yeah.   How about you? Where are you going?",2
Jesse,"Uh, I'm going to Vienna.",2
Céline,Vienna? What's there?,2
Jesse,"Uh, I have no idea. I'm flying out of there tomorrow.",2
Céline,Aha. You on holiday?,2
Jesse,"Uh, ye-   Uh, I don't really know what I'm on.",2
Céline,Okay.,2
Jesse,"I've just been. I'm just traveling around. I've been riding the trains the past two, three weeks.",2
Céline,"You were visiting friends, or just on your own?",2
Jesse,"Uh, yeah. You know I had a friend in Madrid, but, umm...",2
Céline,Madrid? That's nice.,2
Jesse,"Yeah, I got one of those Eurail passes, is what I did.",2
Céline,"That's great. So, has this trip, around Europe, been good for you?",2
Jesse,"Yeah, sure, yeah, it's been, umm...it sucked. You know...",2
Céline,  What?,2
Jesse,"No, uh, it's had its, umm. Well, I'll tell ya, you know, sitting, you know, for weeks on end, looking out the window has actually been kinda great.",2
Céline,What do you mean?,2
Jesse,"Well, you know, for instance, you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn't have.",2
Céline,What kind of ideas?,2
Jesse,You want to hear one?,2
Céline,"Yeah, tell me.",2
Jesse,"Alright, uh, I had this idea, okay?",2
Céline,Um-hmm...,2
Jesse,"For a television show. Some friends of mine are these cable access producers, do you know what that is, cable access?   Umm, I dunno...Anybody can produce a show real cheap, and they have to put it on. Right? And I have this idea for this show that would last twenty-four hours a day for a year straight, right? What you do, is you get three hundred and sixty-five people from cities all over the world, to do these twenty-four hour documents of real time, right, capturing life as it‘s lived. Um, you know, it would start with uh, a guy waking up in the morning, and, uh, you know, taking the long shower, eating a little breakfast, making a little coffee, you know, and, uh, reading the paper.",2
Céline,"Wait, wait. All those mundane, boring things everybody has to do every day of their fucking life?",2
Jesse,"I was going to say the poetry of day to day life, but   you know, you say the way you say it, I'll say it the way I say it...",2
Céline,  I like that.,2
Jesse,"No listen, think about it like this...",2
Céline,Who's gonna want to watch this?,2
Jesse,"Well, alright, think about it like this. Why is it, that a dog, you know, sleeping in the sun, is so beautiful? You know, it is, it‘s beautiful, you know, but a guy, standing at a bank machine, trying to take some money out, looks like a complete moron?",2
Céline,"So, it‘s like a National Geographic program, but on people?",2
Jesse,Yeah!,2
Céline,Hmm.,2
Jesse,What do you think?,2
Céline,"Yeah, I can.   I can see it. Like twenty-four boring hours, sorry, and like a three minute sex scene, where he falls asleep right after, no?",2
Jesse,"Yeah, you know I mean, and...I mean, that would be a GREAT episode.",2
Céline,Yeah.,2
Jesse,"People would talk about that episode. I mean, you and your friends could do one in Paris, if you wanted to, I mean.",2
Céline,"Oh, sure.",2
Jesse,"I dunno, the key, the key  ...thing that kind of haunts me is the distribution, you know. I mean, getting these tapes from town to town, city to city, so that they could play continuously, ‘cause it would have to play all the time, or else it just wouldn't work.",2
Céline,Thank you.,2
Jesse,"Thanks.   You know what? Not service-oriented. It‘s just, I don't know, an observation about Europe.",2
Jesse,"  Alright, I have an admittedly insane idea, but if I don't ask you this, it‘s just, uh, you know, it‘s gonna haunt me the rest of my life.",3
Céline,What?,3
Jesse,"Um...   I want to keep talking to you, you know. I have no idea what your situation is, but, uh, but I feel like we have some kind of uh, connection. Right?",3
Céline,"Yeah, me too.",3
Jesse,"Yeah, right, well, great.   So listen, so here's the deal. This is what we should do. You should get off the train with me here in Vienna, and come check out the town.",3
Céline,  What?,3
Jesse,Come on. It'll be fun. Come on.,3
Céline,What would we do?,3
Jesse,"Umm, I don't know. All I know is I have to catch an Austrian Airlines flight tomorrow morning at nine-thirty, and I don't really have enough money for a hotel, so I was just going to walk around, and it would be a lot more fun if you came with me. And if I turn out to be some kind of psycho, you know, you just get on the next train.",3
Jesse,"Alright, alright. Think of it like this. Umm-uh, jump ahead, ten, twenty years, okay, and you're married. Only your marriage doesn't have that same energy that it used to have, you know. You start to blame your husband. You start to think about all those guys you've met in your life, and what MIGHT have happened if you'd picked up with one of them, right?",3
Céline,  Let me get my bag.,3
Jesse,  Yeah!,3
Jesse,We should get a locker for all this stuff.,3
Céline,Okay.,3
Céline,What's your name?,3
Céline,"You mean, “Jesse James”? No.",3
Jesse,"No, no. Just Jesse.",3
Céline,I'm Céline.,3
Jesse,This is a nice bridge.,4
Céline,Yeah.,4
Céline,This is kind of weird.,4
Jesse,"Yeah, this is kind of weird isn't it? I mean, I feel a little awkward. Um...But it‘s alright, right? It‘s okay.",4
Céline,"Yeah, this is great, this is great. Let's go to some places. Look at your book.",4
Jesse,"Yeah, we're in Vienna, let's go to some places. Let's ask these guys.",4
Jesse,"Excuse me, excuse me uh, sprechen Sie English?",4
Jesse,What?,4
Jesse,"Well, listen, we just got into Vienna today, and we're looking for something fun to do.",4
Céline,"Like museums, exhibitions, things...",4
Jesse,Just for tonight.,4
Jesse,  Uh...,4
Céline,We're on honeymoon.,4
Jesse,"Yeah, she got pregnant, we had to get married, you know.",4
Céline,You're actors?,4
Jesse,"So, you have a real cow on stage.",4
Céline,Great.,4
Céline,"Oh, the big Ferris wheel?",4
Céline,"Oh, we should go.",4
Jesse,Twenty-one thirty?,4
Céline,Nine-thirty.,4
Jesse,"Nine-thirty? Oh, right, right. Okay, great, well, what's the name of this play?",4
Jesse,Alright.,4
Jesse,We'll try to be there.,4
Jesse,We'll try.,4
Jesse,You're the cow.,4
Jesse,"Alright, I got an idea. Are you ready?",5
Céline,Okay.,5
Jesse,"Alright, it's Q&A time. We've known each other a little while now, we're stuck together, so we're going to ask each other a few uh, direct questions. Alright?",5
Céline,"So, we ask each other questions.",5
Jesse,And you have to answer one hundred percent honestly.,5
Céline,Of course.,5
Jesse,"Okay, alright, first question.",5
Céline,You.,5
Jesse,  Describe for me your first sexual feelings towards a person.,5
Jesse,Jean-Marc Fleury?,5
Céline,I remember we were at this summer camp together. And he was a swimmer.,5
Jesse,Um-hmm...,5
Céline,"Yeah, he had bleached out chlorine hair and green eyes. And to improve his times, he'd shave the hair off his legs and arms.",5
Jesse,That's disgusting.,5
Céline,"Oh, no. He was like this gorgeous dolphin. And my friend Emma had a big, big crush on him. So one day I was cutting, you know across the field, back to my room, and he came walking up beside me. You know, and I told him, you know, you should date Emma, she has a big crush on you. And he turned to me and said,   Yeah, it really scared the hell out of me, because I thought he was so fine. And then he officially asked me out on a date, and you know I pretended I didn't like him. You know I was, I was so afraid of what I might do, you know. Uh, well. So, you know, I went to see him swim a few times, at the swim competition. And he was so sexy, really, I mean, really sexy. You know we kind of wrote these little declarations of love to each other at the end of the summer, and you know, promised we would keep writing forever, and I, you know, meet again very soon, and...",5
Jesse,Did you?,5
Céline,Of course not.,5
Jesse,"Well, then I think this is the opportune time to tell you that I happen to be a fantastic swimmer.",5
Céline,Really?,5
Jesse,Yeah.,5
Céline,I'll make note of that.,5
Jesse,Okay. Uh..,5
Céline,"So its my turn, no?",5
Jesse,"Yes, yeah, it's your turn.",5
Céline,"Uh, have you ever been in love?",5
Jesse,Yes. Next question. What was the fir--,5
Céline,"Wait, wait.",5
Jesse,What?,5
Céline,Wait a minute.,5
Jesse,What?,5
Céline,So I can give one word answers?,5
Jesse,"Sure, why not?",5
Céline,"No, no. After I went into such private details about my first sexual feelings.",5
Jesse,"Yeah, I, I know, but, sexual feel...Those are two very different questions. I mean, I could've answered the sexual feelings thing, no problem, but you know, love. Well, what if I asked you about love?",5
Céline,"I would have lied, but at least, you know, I would have made up a great story.",5
Jesse,"  Yeah, well, you would have lied. Great. I mean, love is a complex issue. You know, I mean, it‘s like, uh. I mean, yes, I have told somebody that I love them before, and I have meant it. Was it totally a totally unselfish, giving love? Was it a beautiful thing? Not really, you know. It‘s like love, I mean, uh, I don't know. You know?",5
Céline,"Yeah, I know what you mean.",5
Jesse,"But as far as sexual feelings go, I'll have you know it started with an obsessive relationship with Miss July 1978. Do you know Playboy magazine?",5
Céline,"Oh, yeah, I've heard of it.",5
Jesse,Yeah? Do you know Crystal?,5
Céline,No...,5
Jesse,"You don't know Crystal? Well, I knew Crystal. Well...  Is it, um...my turn now. Okay. Tell me something that really pisses you off, really drives you crazy.",5
Céline,Pisses me off? My God! Everything pisses me off.,5
Jesse,"Okay, okay, list a couple.",5
Céline,"Uh, okay. I hate being told by a strange man, a strange man in the street, you know, like, to smile, like, to make them feel better about their boring life, um, what else? I hate, I hate  that three hundred kilometers from here there's a war going on, you know, people are dying, and nobody knows what to do about it, or they don't give a shit, I don't know. I hate that the media, you know, they are trying to control our minds.",5
Jesse,The media?,5
Céline,"Yeah, the media. You know it‘s very subtle, but you know, it‘s a new form of fascism.   I hate that. I can't stand that, really.",5
Jesse,Is that all?,5
Céline,"Well, there's a lot of things, really. So it‘s my turn.",5
Jesse,Okay.,5
Céline,You're going to answer.,5
Jesse,"Yes, I'll answer.",5
Céline,"Ah, what's a problem for you?",5
Jesse,"You, probably.",5
Céline,What?,5
Jesse,"Um, no, alright, I had a thought the other day that was kind of a--qualifies as a problem.",5
Céline,What is it?,5
Jesse,"Well, it was a thought I had on the train, so...um...okay, alright. Um, do you believe in reincarnation?",5
Céline,"Yeah, yeah, its interesting.",5
Jesse,"Most people, you know, a lot of people talk about the past lives, and things like that, you know, and even if they don't believe in it in some specific way, you know, people have some kind of notion of an eternal soul, right?",5
Céline,Yeah.,5
Jesse,"Okay. Well, this is my thought. Fifty thousand years ago, there are not even a million people on the planet. Ten thousand years ago, there's like two million people on the planet. Now, there's between five and six billion people on the planet, right? Now, if we all have our own, like, individual, unique soul, right, where do they all come from? Are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?. Because if they are, that represents a five thousand-to-one split of each soul in just the last fifty thousand years, which is like a blip in the earth's time. You know, so, at best, we're like these tiny fractions of people, you know, walking... I mean, is that why we're all so scattered? You know, is that why we're all so specialized?",5
Céline,"Wait a minute, I'm not sure I...I don't....",5
Jesse,"Hang on, I know, I know, its a totally scattered thought, which is kind of why it makes sense.",5
Céline,Yeah...   I agree with you.,5
Jesse,Let's get off this damn tram.,5
Jesse,  This place is pretty neat.,6
Céline,"Yeah, there's even a listening booth over there.   I think she's American. A friend of mine told me about her.",6
Jesse,  Do you want to go see if that listening booth still works?,6
Céline,"Yeah, okay.",6
Jesse,Look at this. This is beautiful.,6
Céline,Quickly. It‘s leaving.,6
Céline,"Oh, look, there's a rabbit.",7
Jesse,"Yeah. Hey there, rabbit.",7
Céline,He's so cute.   I visited this as a young teenager. I think it left a bigger impression on me at that time than any of the museums we went to.,7
Jesse,Yeah? It‘s tiny.,7
Céline,I know. There was this little old man that talked to us. He was the groundskeeper. He explained that most of the people are buried here that washed up on the bank of the Danube.,7
Jesse,How old are these?,7
Céline,"Around the beginning of the century or so. It's called the cemetery of the no-name because they often didn't know who these people were. Maybe a first name, that's all.",7
Jesse,Why were all the bodies washing up?,7
Céline,"I think some were from accidents, on boats and things like that, but most of them were suicides that jumped in the river. I always liked the idea of all those unknown people lost in the world. When I was a little girl, I thought that if none of your family or friends knew you were dead, then it‘s like not really being dead. People can invent the best and the worst for you.   Ah, here she is, I think. Yeah, this is, this is the one I remember the most.   She was only thirteen when she died. That meant something to me, you know, I was around that age when I first saw this. Hmm. Now, I'm ten years older, and she's still thirteen, I guess. That's funny.",7
Céline,That's the Danube over there.,8
Jesse,"That's the river, right?",8
Céline,  Yeah.,8
Jesse,  This is gorgeous.,8
Céline,"Yeah, it‘s very beautiful.",8
Jesse,"  We got, uh, we got a sunset here.",8
Céline,Yeah.,8
Jesse,"We got the Ferris wheel. It seems like, um, this would be a...",8
Céline,What?,8
Jesse,"  Uh, you know, uh.",8
Céline,  Are you trying to say you want to kiss me?,8
Céline,  Yes.,8
Céline,But you know what?,8
Jesse,What?,8
Céline,"I don't think it really matters what generation you are born into. Look at my parents. They were these angry, young, May '68 people, revolting against everything. You know, the government, their conservative catholic backgrounds, I mean. I was born not long after, and then my father went on to become this successful architect, and they began to travel all around the world, where he built bridges, and towers, and stuff. I mean, I really can't complain about anything. You know, they love me more than anything in the world, and I have been raised with all the freedom they had fought for. And yet for me now, it‘s another type of fight. We still have to deal with the same old shit, but we can't really know who, or you know, what the enemy is.",8
Jesse,"I don't really know if there is an enemy. You know, I mean, everybody's parents fuck them up. You know, rich kids' parents gave them too much, poor kids' not enough. Too much attention, not enough attention. They either left them, or you know, they stuck around and taught 'em the wrong things. You know. I mean, my parents are just these two people who didn't like each other very much, who, uh, decided to get married and have a kid, and they try their best to be nice to me.",8
Céline,Did your parents divorce?,8
Jesse,"Yeah. Finally. They should have done it a lot sooner, but they stuck together for a while   for the well-being of my sister and I, thank you very much.   I remember my mother once. She told me, right in front of my father, they were having this big fight, that he didn't really want to have me, you know, that he was really pissed off when he found out that she was pregnant with me, you know, that I was this big mistake. And I think that really shaped the way I think. I always saw the world as this place  where I really wasn't meant to be.",8
Céline,That's so sad.,8
Jesse,"No, I mean, I eventually kind of took pride in it. You know, like my life was my own doing, or something. You know, like I was crashing 'The Big Party.'",8
Céline,"That's a way to see it. You know, my parents, they're still married, and I guess they're very happy, but I just think it‘s a healthy process to rebel against everything that came before.",8
Jesse,Yeah. Yeah.,8
Céline,"You know, I've been wondering lately. Do you know anyone who's in a happy relationship?",8
Jesse,"Uh, yeah, sure. You know, I know happy couples. But I think they lie to each other.",8
Céline,"Hmmph. Yeah. People can lead their life as a lie. My grandmother, she was married to this man, and I always thought she had a very simple, uncomplicated love life. But she just confessed to me that she spent her whole life dreaming about another man she was always in love with. She just accepted her fate. It's so sad. And in the same time, I love the idea that she had all those emotions and feelings I never thought she would have had.",8
Jesse,"I guarantee you, it was better that way. If she'd ever got to know him, you know, I'm sure he would have disappointed her eventually.",8
Céline,How do you know? You don't know them.,8
Jesse,"Yeah, I know, I know. It's just, people have these romantic projections they put on everything. You know. That's not based on any kind of reality.",8
Céline,Romantic projections?,8
Jesse,Yeah.,8
Céline,"Oh, Mr. Romantic, up there in the Ferris wheel   Oh, kiss me, the sunset, oh, it‘s so beautiful.",8
Jesse,"Oh, alright, alright, alright. Tell me about your grandmother. What were you saying about her?",8
Céline,"No, uh --",8
Céline,Yeah.,9
Jesse,Come here.,9
Céline,What?,9
Jesse,Come here.,9
Céline,"Look at this palm-reader. She's interesting-looking, no?",9
Jesse,Yeah.,9
Céline,"Uh-oh, uh-oh.",9
Jesse,"What, what?",9
Céline,I just made eye contact.,9
Jesse,She's not coming over here.,9
Céline,"Yes, she is.",9
Jesse,"Oh, shit. Oh, no.",9
Céline,Oh my God. You want your palm read?,9
Jesse,"No, no.",9
Céline,No? Are you sure?,9
Jesse,I'm sure.,9
Céline,Okay.,9
Jesse,Hello.,9
Céline,Here she is.,9
Céline,"  Uh, français, English?",9
Céline,  Yeah. How much is it.,9
Céline,Okay.,9
Céline,I guess so.,9
Jesse,"  I mean, that's very nice and all, I mean, that, you know, we're all stardust, and you're becoming this great woman, I mean, but I hope you don't take that any more seriously than some horoscope in a daily syndicated newspaper.",9
Céline,"You, what are you talking about? I mean, she knew I was on vacation, and that we didn't know each other, and that   I was going to become this great woman.",9
Jesse,"Aw c'mon. But what was that “I am learning” bullshit? I mean, that's WAY condescending. You know? I mean, she wasn't even doing me. I mean, if opportunists like that, ever had to tell the real truth, it would put their ASSES out of business. You know? I mean,  just once, I'd love to see, some little old lady, save up all her money, you know, to go to the fortune teller, and she'd get there, all excited about hearing her future, and the woman would say   , “Um-hmm. Tomorrow, and all your remaining days will be exactly like today--a tedious collection of hours. And you will  have no new passions, and no new thoughts, and no new travels, and when you die, you'll be completely forgotten. Fifty shillings, please.” You know, that I'd like to see.",9
Céline,"It‘s so funny how she almost didn't notice you, you know. It's weird. I wonder why. She was, she was really wise, and intense, no? I really loved what she said, you know?",9
Jesse,"Yeah, of course you do, you know. You pay your money, you get to hear something that makes you feel good about yourself. If you want, maybe there's a seedy section of Vienna, we can go buy a hit of crack, you know. Would you like that? Yeah?",9
Céline,You're so,9
Jesse,"Stardust, Stardust.",9
Céline,"  Ow! Trou du cul!   Ah, there's an exhibition. Yeah, I guess we'll miss it. Doesn't start until next week.",10
Jesse,"Yeah, I think so.",10
Céline,"  I actually saw this one a few years ago in a museum. I stared, and stared at it. Must have been forty-five minutes. I love it. La voie ferre. Ah.   I love the way the people seem to be dissolving into the background.   Look at this one. It‘s like the environments, you know, are stronger than the people. His human figures are always so transitory. It‘s funny. Transitory?",10
Jesse,Yeah. Transitory.,10
Jesse,Think this is open?,11
Céline,"I don't know, let's try it.",11
Céline,"  I was in an old church like this with my grandmother a few days ago in Budapest. Even though I reject most of the religious things, I can't help but feeling for all those people that come here lost or in pain, guilt, looking for some kind of answers. It fascinates me how a single place can join so much pain and happiness for so many generations",11
Jesse,You close with your grandmother?,11
Céline,"Yeah. I think it‘s because I always...I always have this strange feeling that I am this very old woman laying down about to die. You know, that my life is just her memories, or something.",11
Jesse,"That's so wild. I mean, I always think that I'm still this thirteen year old boy, you know who just doesn't really know how to be an adult, pretending to live my life, taking notes for when I'll really have to do it. Kind of like I'm in a dress rehearsal for a Junior High play.",11
Céline,"That's funny. Then, up there in the Ferris wheel, it was like this very old woman kissing this very young boy, right?",11
Jesse,"Hmm. Do you know anything about the Quakers, the Quaker religion?",11
Céline,"No, not much, no.",11
Jesse,"Well, I went to this Quaker wedding once, and it was fantastic. What they do is the couple comes in and they kneel down in front of the whole congregation, and they just stare at each other, and nobody says a word unless they feel that God moves them to speak, or say something. And then, after an hour or so of just uh, staring at each other, they're married.",11
Céline,That's beautiful. I like that.,11
Jesse,This is a horrible story.,11
Céline,What?,11
Jesse,"It‘s not the appropriate place to tell it, but...",11
Céline,What?,11
Jesse,"Well, I was driving around with this buddy of mine, he was a big atheist, and we came to a stop, next to this homeless guy. And my buddy takes out a hundred dollar bill, and leans out the window, and he says, 'Do you believe in God?' And the guy looks at uh, he looks at my friend, and he looks at the money, he says uh, 'Yes, I do.' My friend says, 'Wrong answer.'  , and we drove away.",11
Céline,"That's mean, no?",11
Jesse,"Yeah uh, it‘s uh.",11
Céline,Ow!,12
Jesse,"Would you be in Paris by now, if uh, you hadn't gotten off the train with me?",12
Céline,"  No, not yet. What would you be doing?",12
Jesse,"I'd probably be hanging around the airport, reading old magazines, crying in my coffee   ‘cause you didn't come with me.",12
Céline,"Awwww. Actually, I think I'd probably have gotten off the train in Salzburg with someone else.",12
Jesse,"Oh, yeah? Oh, I see. So, I'm just that dumb American momentarily decorating your bland canvas.",12
Céline,I'm having a great time.,12
Jesse,Yeah?,12
Céline,Yeah.,12
Jesse,Me too.,12
Céline,"I'm so glad because no one knows I'm here, and I don't know anyone that knows you that would tell me all those bad things you've done.",12
Jesse,Mm-hmm?,12
Céline,Yeah.,12
Jesse,I'll tell you some.,12
Céline,"Yeah, I'm sure.",12
Jesse,Mm-hmm.,12
Céline,"You know, you hear so much shit about people. I always feel like the general of an army when I start dating a guy, you know, plotting my strategy and maneuverings, knowing his weak points, what would hurt him, seduce him. It's horrible.   If we were around each other all the time, what do you think would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?",12
Jesse,"No uh, no, no, I'm not gonna answer this question, no.",12
Céline,Why?,12
Jesse,"I just, I dated this girl once who, who used to always ask me that question, “What about me bugs you?” you know. And so finally I said, “Well, you know, I uh, just don't think you handle criticism too well.” She flew into a rage, and broke up with me, alright? That's a true story. All she ever really wanted to do was to have an excuse to tell me what she thought was wrong with me, you know. Is that what you want?",12
Céline,What?,12
Jesse,Something about me bugs you?,12
Céline,No.,12
Jesse,It's alright. Tell me. What is it? What about me bugs you?,12
Céline,"Nothing, nothing at all.",12
Jesse,"Well, if it had to be something, what would it be?",12
Céline,"If it had to be something, if I had to think about it, I...I kind of didn't really like this reaction back at the palm reader. You were like this rooster prick.",12
Jesse,“Rooster prick”?,12
Céline,Yeah.,12
Jesse,What the hell a “rooster prick”?,12
Céline,You were like a little boy whining because all the attention wasn't focused on him.,12
Jesse,"Alright, listen, this woman robs you blind, okay?",12
Céline,"You were like a little boy walking by an ice cream store, crying because his mother wouldn't buy him a milkshake or something.",12
Jesse,I don't care what this woman has to say about anything.,12
Céline,What?,12
Céline,"Oh, I understand a little bit, but he doesn't, I'm sorry.",12
Céline,Yeah.,12
Céline,Okay.,12
Jesse,"Great, alright.",12
Jesse,Ummm...,12
Céline,A word uh...milkshake.,12
Jesse,"“Milkshake”? Oh, good. Yeah, I was gonna say “rooster prick,” but great.   “Milkshake.”",12
Jesse,"Yeah, right, so we'll...",12
Céline,Good.,12
Jesse,  What can I say? I like this Viennese variation of a bum.,12
Céline,"I like what he said about adding something to your life, no?",12
Jesse,"Yeah. So uh, were we having our first fight back there?",12
Céline,No...,12
Jesse,"Yeah, I think so, I think we were.",12
Céline,"Well, even if we were a little bit, you know. Why does everyone think conflict is so bad? There's a lot of good things coming out of conflict.",12
Jesse,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I don't know, you know? I always think that if I could just accept the fact that my life was supposed to be difficult, you know, that's what's to be expected, then, I might not get so pissed off about it, and I'd just be glad when something nice happens.",12
Céline,"Maybe that's why I'm still in school, you know. It‘s easier to have something to fight against.",12
Jesse,"Yeah, well, we've all had such competitiveness engrained in us...",12
Jesse,"...you know, I could be doing the most nothing thing, you know, I could be uh, throwing some darts, or shooting some pool, and all of a sudden, I feel it come over me, “I have got to win.”",12
Céline,Is that why you tried to get me off the train? Competitiveness?,12
Jesse,What do you mean?,12
Jesse,"  Oh, alright.",12
Céline,  Will you read it to us?,12
Céline,  Great. Thanks.,12
Jesse,"Thanks, man.   Uh here you go, uh",12
Céline,"Here, thank you.",12
Jesse,"Yeah, good luck, man.",12
Céline,"That's wonderful, no?",12
Jesse,"Yeah, yeah.",12
Céline,What?,12
Jesse,"You know he probably didn't just write that. I mean, you know he wrote it, but he probably just plugs that word in  , you know, whatever “milkshake”...",12
Céline,What do you mean?,12
Jesse,"  Nothing, I love it, it was great.",12
Jesse,You know what drives me crazy?,13
Céline,What?,13
Jesse,"It‘s all these people talking about how great technology is, and how it saves all this time. But, what good is saved time, if nobody uses it? If it just turns into more busy work.",13
Céline,Yeah.,13
Jesse,"Right, I mean, you never hear somebody say, ""Well, you know, with uh, the time I've saved by using my word processor, I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery and hang out."" I mean, you never hear that.",13
Céline,Time is so abstract anyway. Were you looking at this girl?,13
Jesse,What? What?,13
Céline,Nothing.,13
Jesse,Do you want to go in here?,13
Céline,What?,13
Jesse,Do you want to go in here?,13
Céline,"Yeah. It‘s a club, no?",13
Jesse,Yeah.,13
Céline,Wanna go?,13
Jesse,Yeah.,13
Céline,  Allo.,13
Céline,  Fifty shillings.,13
Jesse,  Fifty shillings.,13
Céline,Each.,13
Jesse,"I got a hundred. Here, I got it.",13
Céline,I'll buy you a beer.   Thank you.,13
Jesse,You gonna buy me a beer?,13
Céline,Alright.,13
Jesse,  You think Ole Milwaukee's a little expensive here?,13
Céline,  Merde!,13
Jesse,"  Well, um, we haven't talked about this yet, but are you dating anyone? You got a boyfriend waiting on you back in Paris, or anything like that?",13
Céline,"No, not right now.",13
Jesse,Not right but you did?,13
Céline,We broke up about six months ago.,13
Jesse,Six months ago.,13
Céline,Yeah.,13
Jesse,"I'm sorry. I mean, I'm not that sorry. But, uh, tell me about it.",13
Céline,"Ah, no. No, no way, I can't. It‘s really, really boring.",13
Jesse,"C'mon, tell me about it.",13
Céline,"Okay. I was really disappointed. I thought this one would last for a while. I mean he was very stupid, ugly, bad in bed, alcoholic, you know.",13
Jesse,Real prize-winner.,13
Céline,"Yeah.   I was kind of giving him a favor, but he left me, saying I loved him too much, and, you know, I was blocking his artistic expression, or some shit like that, you know. But anyway, I was traumatized, and became   and became totally obsessed with him. And so I went to see this shrink, you know, and it came out that I had written this little stupid story about this woman, trying to kill her boyfriend, and how she was gonna do it, you know, with all the intricate details of, you know, how to do it, and not get caught,  And...",13
Jesse,She was gonna kill her boyfriend?,13
Céline,"Yeah. Yeah, she was. I mean, it’s nothing I would do, but it was just some writing, you know.",13
Jesse,"Alright, no, no, I understand.",13
Céline,"But anyway, this stupid shrink believed everything I was telling her, and it was my first time seeing her. She said she had to call the police.",13
Jesse,She had to call the police?,13
Céline,"  Yeah. She was, merde! She was totally convinced I was really gonna do it, you know, even though I'd explained to her it was just some writing, you know. She said, looking deep into my eyes, ""The way you said it, I know you are going to do it, the way you said it."" She was totally out of her mind. It was my first and last session.",13
Jesse,"Yeah, so what happened then?",13
Céline,"I totally got over him, you know. But now I'm obsessed that he's gonna die from an accident, or you know, a thousand kilometers away, I'm gonna be the one accused. Why do you become obsessed with people you don't really like that much, you know, I mean",13
Jesse,I don't know.,13
Céline,"So, how about you?",13
Jesse,What?,13
Céline,Are you with anyone?,13
Jesse,"Umm, it‘s funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long, isn't it?",13
Céline,"Yeah, but now you have to tell me.",13
Jesse,"Well, I kind of see love as this uh, escape for two people who don't know how to be alone, you know, or uh, I mean, you know it‘s funny. People always talk about how love is this totally unselfish, giving thing, but if you think about it, you know, there's nothing more selfish.",13
Céline,"Yeah, I know. So, who just broke up with you?",13
Jesse,What?,13
Céline,"You sound like you've just been hurt, or something.",13
Jesse,No...do I?,13
Céline,Yeah.,13
Jesse,"Alright. Um, big confession, you know. I should have told you this earlier, Céline, but, you know...I didn't just come to Europe just to hang out, and read Hemingway in Paris, and shit  like that, you know. I saved up my money all spring to uh, fly to Madrid, and spend the summer with my girlfriend, who has been on this...",13
Céline,Your girlfriend?,13
Jesse,"  My EX-girlfriend, who has been on this asinine art history program for the last year. Anyway, I got here, right, and now we're reunited, at long last, and we went out to dinner, our first night ah, with six of her friends: Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo, Maria, Suzie, from home, you know? She pretty much managed to avoid being alone with me for the first couple of days we were there, and I stuck around for a while, just to kind of let it really sink in that she wished I hadn't come. So I bought the cheapest flight out of Europe, this one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow, but it didn't leave for a couple of weeks. So, I bought this Eurail pass, you know? You know you know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you? It‘s when you remember how little you thought about the people you broke up with, and you realize that that is how little they're thinking about you, you know?   You know, you'd like to think that you're both in all this pain, but really, they're just, “Hey, I'm glad you're gone.“",13
Céline,I know. You should look at bright colors.,13
Jesse,What?,13
Céline,"That's what the shrink told me, you know. I was paying her nine-hundred francs an hour, to hear that I was a homicidal maniac, and that I could eliminate my obsession if I would concentrate on bright colours.",13
Jesse,"Yeah, well did it work?",13
Céline,Well,13
Jesse,"Didn't help your pinball, did it?",13
Céline,"No. Yeah, well, you know. I haven't...I haven't killed anyone lately.",13
Jesse,"Not lately? Well, that's good, you're cured, then.",13
Jesse,"I mean, there's these breeds of monkeys, right, and all they do is have sex, like all the time, you know? And uh, they turn out to be, like the least violent, the most peaceful, the most  happy, you know, so I mean, maybe fooling around is not so bad.",14
Céline,  Are you talking about monkeys?,14
Jesse,Yes. I'm talking about monkeys.,14
Céline,"Ah, I thought so, yeah.",14
Jesse,Why?,14
Céline,"You know, I never heard this one, but it reminds me of, like this perfect, you know, male argument to justify them fooling around.",14
Jesse,"No, no, no. Woman monkeys are fooling around, too.   Everybody's fooling around.",14
Céline,"Yeah, that's cute.   You know, I have this awful paranoid thought, that feminism was mostly invented by men, so they could, like, fool around a little more. You know, women, free your minds, free your bodies, sleep with me. We're all happy and free as long as I can fuck   as much as I want.",14
Jesse,"Alright, alright, alright. But maybe, maybe there's some biological things at work here. I mean, if you had an island, right, and there were ninety-nine women on the island, and only one man, in a year, you'd have the possibility of ninety-nine babies. But if you have an island with ninety-nine men, and only one woman, in a year, you'd have the possibility of only one baby. So...",14
Céline,So. You know what?,14
Jesse,What? gu kha,14
Céline,"On this island, you know, I think that there will only be, like maybe forty-three men left. Because they would kill each other, trying to fuck this poor woman, you know what I mean? And on the other island, there would be ninety-nine women, ninety-nine babies, and no more man, because they would have all gotten together, and eaten him alive.",14
Jesse,Oh yeah?,14
Céline,Yeah.,14
Jesse,"  Yeah? Yeah? See...see, I think there's something to that. I think on some level, women don't mind the idea of destroying a man, you know. Like, I was once walking down the street with my ex-girlfriend, you know, right, and we just walked by these, like real four, kind of   thuggy looking guys, next to a Camaro, you know, and one of 'em, sure enough, says, “Hey baby, nice ass.” You know, I mean. So, I'm like alright, “Hey, no big deal,” I'm not gonna get uptight about this, right?",14
Céline,"Yeah, plus, there were four of them, right?",14
Jesse,"Yeah, exactly, there's four of them, right, but she turns around and she says,   “Fuck you, dickheads,” and I'm like, okay, wait a minute, here, right? They're not gonna come over here and kick her ass, you know what I mean? So who just got pushed to the front line on that one? You see what I'm saying? I mean, women say they hate it if you‘re all territorial and protective, but if it suits them, then they'll tell you you're being all unmanly, or wimpy, or uh",14
Céline,"You know what? I don't think women really want to destroy men, and if, even if they want to, they don't...they don't succeed. You know what I mean? I'm sure even, you know, men are destroying women, or are able...capable of destroying women, much more than women...Well, anyway, it‘s depressing, I mean you know what?",14
Jesse,What? You want to stop talking about this?,14
Céline,"Yeah. I really hate it. You know, men, women you know, it‘s, it‘s...there's no end to this, like, you know...",14
Jesse,"It‘s like a skipping record, you know?",14
Céline,Yeah.,14
Jesse,Every couple's been having this conversation forever.,14
Céline,And nobody's come up with anything.,14
Céline,I saw a documentary on that. It's a birth dance.,14
Jesse,A birth dance?,14
Céline,Yeah.,14
Jesse,Should I give her some money?,14
Céline,Yeah.,14
Jesse,"  Everything that's interesting costs a little bit of money. I'm telling you. So, birth dance, huh? Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.",14
Céline,"No, but really. Women used this when giving birth. In some parts of the world, they still do it.",14
Jesse,Yeah?,14
Céline,"Yeah. The woman in labor enters a tent, and the women of her tribe surround her, and dance, and they encourage the birthing woman to dance with them as...so as to make the birth less painful.",14
Jesse,Yeah...,14
Céline,"When the baby is born, they all dance in celebration.",14
Jesse,Wow. I don't think my mom would've gone for that.,14
Céline,"I like the idea of dancing as a common function in life, something everybody participates in.",14
Jesse,"Yeah, I know. I heard about this old guy, who was watching some young people dance. And he said, how beautiful. They're trying to shake off their genitals, and become angels.",14
Céline,I like that,14
Jesse,"Alright. One question, though, back there. When the women are dancing, and being all spiritual, and stuff, right? Where are the men? Are we out food-gathering? Are we not invited? Y'all don't need us? What?",14
Céline,"Men are lucky we don't bite off their head after mating. Certain insects do that, you know, like spiders, and stuff.",14
Jesse,Mm-hmm.,14
Céline,"We, at least, let you live. What are you complaining about?",14
Jesse,"Yes. See, you're officially kidding, but there's something to that, you know. You keep bringing stuff like that up.",14
Céline,What?,14
Jesse,Yeah.,14
Céline,"No, no, no, wait a minute. Talking seriously here. I mean,...I, I always feel this pressure of being a strong and independent icon of womanhood, and without making...making it look my...my  whole life is revolving around some guy. But loving someone, and being loved means so much to me. We always make fun of it and stuff. But isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a  little more?",14
Jesse,"Hmmm. Yeah, I don't know   Sometimes I dream about being a good father and a good husband, and sometimes that feels really close.",14
Céline,Hmm.,14
Jesse,"But then, other times, it seems silly. Like it would uh, ruin my whole life. And it‘s not just a uh, a fear of commitment, or that I'm incapable of caring, or loving, because I can. It's just that if I'm totally honest with myself, I think I'd rather die knowing that I was really good at something, that I had excelled in some way, you know, then that I had just been in a nice, caring relationship.",14
Céline,"Yeah, but I had worked for this older man, and once he told me that he had spent all of his life thinking about his career and his work, and...he was fifty-two and it suddenly struck him that he had never really given anything of himself. His life was for no one, and nothing. He was almost crying saying that. You know, I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us. Not you, or me...but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something.   I know, it‘s almost impossible to succeed, but...who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.",14
Céline,"Okay, now I'm going to call my best friend in Paris, who I'm supposed to have lunch with in eight hours. Okay?",15
Jesse,  Okay.,15
Céline,  Dring-Dring. Dring-Dring. Dring-Dring. Pick up!,15
Jesse,What?,15
Céline,Pick up the phone!,15
Jesse,"  Oh, hello?",15
Céline,Allo?,15
Jesse,Mm-hmm.,15
Céline,"Vanie? Ici Celine, hein?",15
Jesse,Ahh...,15
Céline,Comment ça-va?,15
Jesse,  Ca va bien. Et toi?,15
Céline,"Vanie, ma vacation est incroyable!",15
Jesse,"Ahhh...y' -a- I- you know, I've been working on my English, recently, w- y'want to talk in English?",15
Céline,"Yeah, okay, that's a good idea. Ummm...I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it for lunch today, I'm sorry. I...I met a guy on the train, and I got off with him in Vienna. We're still   there.",15
Jesse,Are you crazy?,15
Céline,Probably.,15
Jesse,"We...wa...he's Austrian, he's from there?",15
Céline,N-n-n-n-no. He's passing through here too. He's American. He's going back home tomorrow morning.,15
Jesse,  Why'd you get off the train with him?,15
Céline,"Well...he convinced me. Well, actually I was...  I was ready to get off the train with him after talking to him a short while. He was so sweet, I couldn't help it. We were in the lounge car, and he began to talk about him, as a little boy, seeing his great-grandmother's ghost. I think that's when I fell for him. Just the idea of this little boy with all those beautiful dreams. He TRAPPED me.",15
Jesse,Mm-hmm.,15
Céline,"And he's so cute! He has beautiful blue eyes  , nice pink lips  , greasy hair.   I love it. He's kind of tall, and a little clumsy.   I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away.   He kind of kisses like an adolescent, it‘s so cute.",15
Jesse,  What?!,15
Céline,"Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable. As the night went on, I began to like him more and more. But I'm afraid he's scared of me. You know, I told him the story about the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend, and stuff. He must be scared to death.   He must be thinking I'm this manipulative, mean woman. I just hope he doesn't feel that way about me, because you know me, I'm the most harmless person. The only person I could really hurt is myself.",15
Jesse,I don't think he's scared of you. I think he's crazy about you.,15
Céline,Really?,15
Jesse,"I mean, I've known you a long time, and I got a good feeling. You gonna see him again?",15
Céline,We haven't talked about that yet.   Okay it‘s your turn. You call your friend.,15
Jesse,Uh...,15
Céline,Okay?,15
Jesse,"  Alright, alright. Umm...  Uh,   Bring-Bring-Bring. Uh, I usually get this guys answering machine. Brawwwwwwng.",15
Céline,"  Hi dude, what's up?",15
Jesse,"Uhhhh...Hey Frank, how you been? Glad you're home.",15
Céline,"Cool. Yeah. So, how was Madrid?",15
Jesse,"Uh, Madrid...SUCKED. You know, Lisa and I had our long-overdue meltdown.",15
Céline,"Oh. Too bad. I told you, no?",15
Jesse,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing just never works. I was only in Madrid for a couple of days. I got a cheaper flight, out of Vienna...but uh, you know, it really wasn't that much cheaper. I just uh...I couldn't go home right away. I didn't want to see anybody I knew, I just wanted to be a ghost. Completely anonymous.",15
Céline,"So are you okay, now?",15
Jesse,"Yeah. Yeah, no, no, yeah, I'm great, I'm great! That's the thing, I'm...I'm rapturous. And I'll tell you why. I met somebody. On my last night in Europe, can you believe that?",15
Céline,"Ah, that's incredible.",15
Jesse,"I know, I know. And you know how they say we're all each others' demons and angels? Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel. Just telling me that everything was gonna be okay.",15
Céline,How did you meet?,15
Jesse,"On the train. Yeah, she was sitting next to this very weird couple who started fighting so she had to move. She sat right across the aisle from me. So, we started to talk, and uh, she   didn't like me much at first. She's super smart  , very passionate, um...and beautiful  . And I was so unsure of myself. I thought everything I said sounded so stupid.",15
Céline,"Oh, man, I wouldn't worry about that.",15
Jesse,No...,15
Céline,"No, I'm sure she was not judging you. No...and by the way, she sat next to you, no? I'm sure she did it on purpose.",15
Jesse,"Oh, Yeah?",15
Céline,Yeah. Us men are so stupid. We don't understand anything about women.,15
Jesse,Mm-hmm.,15
Céline,They act kind of strange. The little I know of them. Don't they?,15
Jesse,  Yeah.,15
Jesse,"I feel like this is uh, some dream world we're in, you know.",16
Céline,"Yeah, it's so weird. It‘s like our time together is just ours. It‘s our own creation. It must be like I'm in your dream, and you in mine, or something.",16
Jesse,"And what's so cool is that this whole evening, all our time together, shouldn't officially be happening.",16
Céline,"Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why this feels so otherworldly. But then the morning comes, and we turn into pumpkins, right?",16
Jesse,Ahhh...,16
Céline,"Yeah, I know.   But at this time, I think you're supposed to produce the glass slipper, and see if it fits.",16
Jesse,Yeah?,16
Céline,Yeah.,16
Jesse,It'll fit.,16
Jesse,"This friend of mine had a kid, and it was a home birth, so he was there helping out and everything. And he said at that profound moment of birth uh, he was watching this child, experiencing life for the first time, I mean, trying to take its first breath...all he could think about was that he was looking at something that was gonna die someday. He just couldn't get it out of his head. And I think that's so true, I mean, all-- everything is so finite. I mean, but, but don't you think that that's what um, makes our time, at specific moments, so important?",17
Céline,"Yeah, I know. It's the same for us, tonight, though. After tomorrow morning, we're probably never going to see each other again, right?",17
Jesse,You don't think we'll ever see each other again?,17
Céline,What do you think?,17
Jesse,"Well um, gosh, I don't know. Uh, I mean, I hadn't planned another trip to...",17
Céline,"Oh, me too, you know. I live in Paris, you live in the U.S. I totally understand that...",17
Jesse,"I mean, I'd hate to make you fly. You know, you hate to fly, right?",17
Céline,I'm not so scared of flying. I mean I could...,17
Jesse,"I mean, if you were gonna come to the U.S. or if, you know, I mean if I, or you know, I mean, I could come back here, I mean...  What?",17
Céline,"Now let's just be rational adults about this. We, maybe we should try something different. I mean, it‘s not so bad if tonight is our only night, right? People always exchange phone numbers, addresses, they end up writing once, calling each other once or twice...",17
Jesse,"Right. Fizzles out. Yeah, I mean, I don't want that. I hate that.",17
Céline,"I hate that too, you know.",17
Jesse,Why do you think everybody thinks relationships are supposed to last forever?,17
Céline,"Yeah, why. It's stupid.",17
Jesse,"So, you think tonight's it, huh? I mean, that tonight's our only night.",17
Céline,"It‘s the only way, no?",17
Jesse,"Well, alright. Let's do it. No delusions, no projections. We'll just make tonight great.",17
Céline,"Okay, let's do that.",17
Jesse,Okay.,17
Jesse,"We should do some kind of handshake, you know? Give me your hand.   Alright. To our one and only night together, and the hours that remain.   What?",17
Céline,"It‘s just...it‘s depressing, no? That the...the only thing we're gonna think of is when we're gonna have to say goodbye tomorrow.",17
Jesse,"Well, we could say goodbye now. Then we wouldn't have to worry about it in the morning.",17
Céline,Now?,17
Jesse,Yeah. Say goodbye.,17
Céline,Bye.,17
Jesse,Goodbye.,17
Céline,  you have a...  Au revoir.,17
Jesse,Later!,17
Céline,"Later, yeah.",17
Jesse,"Alright, so here's the plan, right. You're gonna grab the glasses, and I'm gonna get the wine.",18
Céline,Red wine.,18
Jesse,Red wine. Right.,18
Céline,You think you can do that?,18
Jesse,Noooo problem.,18
Jesse,  Wish me good luck.,18
Céline,  Good luck.,18
Jesse,  Hello.,18
Jesse,  Uh...Do you speak English?,18
Jesse,"Yeah, a bit? I'm having kind of an odd situation...which is that...this is...you see that girl over there?",18
Jesse,"Yeah, well, this is our only night together. Um, and she, ahh...here’s the problem, the problem is that she wants a bottle of red wine, and I don't have any money.   But I was thinking that you might want to...um, give me the address of this bar.   No I know, and I would promise to send you the money, and you’d be making our night complete.",18
Jesse,Yes.,18
Jesse,Thank you very much,18
Céline,"So often in my life I've been with people and shared beautiful moments like travelling, or staying up all night and watching the sunrise, and I knew those were special moments. But something was always wrong. I wished I’d been with someone else.   I knew that what I was feeling, exactly what was so important to me, they didn't understand. But I'm happy to be with you. You couldn't possibly know why a night like this is so important to my life right now, but it is...This is a great morning.",19
Jesse,It is a great morning. Do you think we have others like this?   What?,19
Jesse,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean about wishing somebody wasn't there though, It‘s just, usually, it‘s myself that I wish I could get away from. Seriously, think about this. I have never been anywhere that I haven't been. I've never had a kiss when I wasn't one of the kissers. You know, I've never, um, gone to the movies, when I wasn't there in the audience. I've never been out bowling, if I wasn't there, making some stupid joke. That's why so many people hate themselves. Seriously. It’s just they are sick to death of being around themselves. Let‘s say that you and I were together all the time, then you'd start to hate a lot of my mannerisms. The way...the way every time that we would have people over...I'd be insecure, and I'd get a little too drunk. Or...the way I tell the same stupid pseudo-intellectual story again, and again. Y'see, I've heard all those stories...So of course I'm sick of myself. But being with you...it‘s made me feel like I was somebody else. I mean the only other way to lose yourself like that is...you know, dancing...or alcohol...or drugs or stuff like that.",19
Céline,Fucking?,19
Jesse,Fuh... Fucking? Yeah. That's one way. Yeah.,19
Céline,  Do you know what I want?,19
Jesse,What?,19
Céline,  To be kissed.,19
Jesse,"Well, I could do that.",19
Céline,Wait!   I have to say something stupid.,19
Jesse,Alright.,19
Céline,It‘s very stupid.,19
Jesse,Okay.,19
Céline,"I don't think we should sleep together. I mean, I want to, but since we're never going to see each other again...it'll make me feel bad. I‘ll wonder who else you're with. I'll miss you.   I know. It's not very adult. Maybe it‘s a female thing. I can't help it.",19
Jesse,Let's see each other again.,19
Céline,"No, I don't want you to break our vow, just so you can get LAID.",19
Jesse,"I don't want to just get laid. I want to--I mean...I think we should. I mean, we'll die in the morning, right? I think we should.",19
Céline,"No, then it‘s like some male fantasy. Meet a French girl, fuck her, and never see her again. And have this great story to tell. I don’t wanna be a great story, I don‘t want this great evening to just have been for that.",19
Jesse,"Alright. Alright, alright, alright. Okay, okay.",19
Céline,Okay?,19
Jesse,Okay. We don't have to have sex. It's not a big deal.,19
Céline,Okay.   You don't want to see me again?,19
Jesse,"  No, of course I do. Listen.   If somebody gave me the choice right now, of to never see you again or to marry you, alright, I would marry you, alright? And maybe that's a lot of romantic bullshit...but people have gotten married for a lot less.",19
Céline,"Actually...I think I decided I wanted to sleep with you when we got off the train. But now that we've talked so much, I don't know anymore.",19
Céline,Why do we make everything so complicated?,19
Jesse,I don't know.,19
Jesse,What's the first thing you'll do when you get back to Paris?,20
Céline,Call my parents.,20
Jesse,Yeah?,20
Céline,What about you?,20
Jesse,I don't know...I'll probably go pick up my dog. He's still with a friend of mine.,20
Céline,You have a dog?,20
Jesse,Yeah.,20
Céline,I love dogs.,20
Jesse,You do?,20
Céline,Yeah.,20
Jesse,Oh shit!,20
Céline,What?,20
Jesse,"Oh, I don't know. We're back in real time.",20
Céline,I know. I hate that.,20
Jesse,What is that?,20
Céline,Sounds like a harpsichord.,20
Jesse,Check that out.,20
Céline,Somebody’s playing.,20
Jesse,  That’s cool.,20
Jesse,Can we dance to the harpsichord?,20
Céline,Of course.,20
Jesse,"  Oh, wow.",20
Céline,What?,20
Jesse,I'm gonna take your picture   so I never forget you...or...or all this.,20
Céline,"Okay. Me, too.",20
Jesse,  “The years shall run like rabbits.“,21
Céline,  What?,21
Jesse,"  Nothing, nothing. I have this, uh, recording of Dylan Thomas, reading a W.H.Auden poem. He's got a great voice. Just it's like, uh...",21
Céline,"What, what?",21
Céline,"That‘s good.   When you talked earlier about after a few years, how a couple begin to hate each other...by anticipating their reactions...or getting tired of their mannerisms. I think it would be the opposite for me. I think I can really fall in love when I know everything about someone. The way he's gonna part his hair...which shirt he's gonna wear that day...knowing the exact story he'd tell in a given situation. I'm sure that's when I know I'm really in love.",21
Jesse,"Hey, guess what?",21
Céline,What?,21
Jesse,We didn't go to those guys' play.,21
Céline,Play?,21
Jesse,Yeah.,21
Céline,With the cow?,21
Jesse,Yeah.,21
Céline,"  Yeah, we didn't. Oh no, we missed it.",21
Céline,"Okay, you know what bus to take to the airport?",22
Jesse,"Yeah, yeah. No problem.",22
Céline,I should get on this one,22
Jesse,Right here? You wanna to get on there?,22
Céline,Yeah.,22
Jesse,Alright. Um...,22
Céline,"Okay. I guess this is it, no?",22
Jesse,"  Yeah. Um, I really,   I, uh, I... I mean, you know.",22
Céline,"Yeah, I know, me too -- I, uh. Yeha, My...Have a great life. Have fun with everything you're gonna do. Work hard...",22
Jesse,"Yeah. Good luck with school, and all that.",22
Céline,Okay.,22
Jesse,I hate this.,22
Céline,Me too. The train is about to leave.,22
Jesse,Yeah.,22
Jesse,Listen. Listen. You know all this bullshit we're talking about...about not seeing each other again? I don't want to do that.,22
Céline,I don't want to do that either.,22
Jesse,You don't?,22
Céline,I waited for you to say it.,22
Jesse,"Well, why didn't you say something?",22
Céline,I was afraid you didn't wanna see me.,22
Jesse,"Alright, alright, well look. Listen, listen. What-d...what-d...What do you wanna do?",22
Céline,"Maybe... maybe we should meet here, in five years or something.",22
Jesse,"Alright, alright. Five years.   Five years? That's a long time.",22
Céline,Yes. It‘s awful. It‘s like a sociological experiment. How about one year?,22
Jesse,"One year. Alright, alright.",22
Céline,One year.,22
Jesse,How about six months?,22
Céline,Six months?,22
Jesse,Yeah.,22
Céline,It‘s gonna be freezing.,22
Jesse,Yeah?,22
Céline,Yeah.,22
Jesse,"Who cares? We come here, we go somewhere else.",22
Céline,"Okay. Okay. Uh, six months from now, or last night?",22
Jesse,"Um...Last night. Six months from last night, which was...June 16th. So...track nine, six months from now at six o'clock, at night.",22
Céline,Dece--December.,22
Jesse,"December, yeah, right. Now listen, it‘s a train ride for you, but I got to fly all the way here. But I'm gonna be here.",22
Céline,"Okay, me too.",22
Jesse,Alright.,22
Céline,And we won‘t call...or write or...,22
Jesse,Na...,22
Céline,Na.,22
Jesse,It‘s depressing.,22
Céline,"Yeah, okay.",22
Jesse,"Alright.   Alright, your train's gonna leave. Say goodbye.",22
Céline,Bye.,22
Jesse,Goodbye.,22
