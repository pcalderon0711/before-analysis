Jesse,"Hmmm...well, I mean, isn’t everything autobiographical? I mean, we all see the world through our own tiny keyhole, right? I mean, I always think of Thomas Wolfe, you know, have you ever seen that little one page note to reader in the front of ""Look Homeward, Angel,"" right, you know what I'm talking about? Anyway, he says that we are the sum of all the moments of our lives, and that, uh, anybody who sits down to write is gonna use the clay of their own life, that you can't avoid that. So when I look at my own life, you know, I have to admit, right...that I've... I've never been around a bunch of, a bunch of guns, or violence. You know, not really. No political intrigue or, uh, helicopter crash, right?",1
Jesse,"But my life, from my own point of view, has been full of drama, right? And, uh, so I thought that if I could write a book that...that could capture what it's like to really meet somebody. I mean one of the most exciting things that's ever happened to me is to really meet somebody, make that connection, and if I could...make that valuable, you know, to capture that, that would be the attempt or...Did I answer your question?",1
Jesse,"  See, to me, that...that's not important, you know?",1
Jesse,"  Alright, since I'm in France and this is the last stop on my book tour, ""yes"".",1
Jesse,"Like they promised, uh... I think how you answer that, you know, is, uh...You know, it's... It's a good test. Right? If you're a romantic or a cynic. I mean, uh, you think  ...you think they get back together,   you don't, for sure, and   you hope they do, but, you know, you’re not sure so that’s why you're asking the question.",1
Jesse,"  Did I real...  Look, see, in the words of my grandfather, OK...to answer that, would take the piss out of the whole thing.",1
Jesse,"Ah...I don't know, man, I don't know...I've been...I've been thinking about this...Well, I always kind of wanted to write a book that all took place within the space of a pop song, you know, like 3 or 4 minutes long, the whole thing.",1
Jesse,"The story, the idea is that...there's this guy. Right? And...he's totally depressed. I mean, his great dream was to be a lover, an adventurer, you know, riding motorcycles through South America, and instead he's sitting at a marble table, eating lobster, and he's got a good job and a beautiful wife, right? But you know, everything that he needs. But that doesn't matter, 'cause what he wants is to fight for meaning.",1
Jesse,"You know, happiness is in the doing, right, not in the... getting what you want. So, he's sitting there, and just at that second, his little five year old daughter hops up on the table. And he knows that she should get down 'cause she could get hurt, but she's dancing to this pop song, in a summer dress. And he looks down, and all of a sudden, uh, he is sixteen. And...his high school sweetheart is dropping him off, at home. And they've just lost their virginity, and she loves him, and the same song is playing on the car radio, and she climbs up and starts dancing on the roof of the car. And now, now he's worried about her! And she’s beautiful, with a...a facial expression just like his daughter‘s. In fact, you know, maybe that's why he even likes her. You see, he knows he's not remembering this dance, he's there. He's there in both moments simultaneously. And just like for an instance  , all his life is just folding in on itself and it's obvious to him that time is a lie...  uh...that's it's all happening all the time and inside every moment is another moment, all...You know, happening simultaneously.",1
Jesse,"And, anyway, that’s that's kind of the idea...anyway.",1
Jesse,Thank you all.   How much longer before I have to go to the airport?,1
Jesse,OK.,1
Jesse,Hi.,1
Céline,Hello.,1
Jesse,How are you?,1
Céline,"Good, and you?",1
Jesse,"I'm...good, yeah, I'm great, I'm...uh...Do you want to...maybe get a cup of coffee?",1
Céline,Didn't you just say you have a plane to catch?,1
Jesse,"Uh yeah...  But, I mean, I have a little time.",1
Céline,OK.,1
Jesse,"Yeah? Well, let me um...",1
Céline,I'll meet you outside.   OK.,1
Jesse,"Excuse me, I'm just gonna go out and get a cup of coffee, and be back at 7:15.",1
Jesse,"Um yeah, I sure did.",1
Jesse,"Alright, thanks for everything.   Merci beaucoup, mademoiselle.",1
Jesse,I can't believe you're here!,2
Céline,"Well, I live here in Paris. Are you sure you don't have to stay, you're not supposed to talk some more?",2
Jesse,"No, no, no, they‘re sick of me, I spent the night here last night.",2
Céline,"Oh, you did?",2
Jesse,"Yeah, yeah, they've got a loft upstairs.",2
Céline,"Oh, wow.",2
Jesse,"Anyway, how are you?   This is so weird.",2
Céline,"I'm fine, it's... It's good to see you.",2
Jesse,It's good to see you.,2
Céline,So you want to go to a cafe?,2
Jesse,"Uh, yeah...",2
Céline,"OK, there's one a little further, that I like.",2
Jesse,"I...I...I thought I was gonna totally lose it in there. When I first saw you...I mean, how did you even know I was going to be here?",2
Céline,"Well, it's my favorite bookstore in Paris. I, um...You can sit down for hours and read. I love it. There's fleas, but, you know...",2
Jesse,"I know, I know, I think a cat slept on my head last night.",2
Céline,"So, I saw your picture on the calendar about a month ago.",2
Jesse,Yeah?,2
Céline,"And that you were going to be here. It's funny because I read an article on your book, and, uh, it sounded vaguely familiar?",2
Jesse,"Vaguely, yeah.",2
Céline,"Yes. But I didn't put it all together until I saw your photo, so...",2
Jesse,Did you have a chance to read it?,2
Céline,"Yes! I um...I was really, really surprised as you can imagine, I mean...I had to read it twice, actually.",2
Jesse,Yeah?,2
Céline,Yeah.,2
Jesse,"Comme ci, comme ca?",2
Céline,"No, I liked it! It's, uh, very romantic. I usually don't like that... but it's, uh, really well written. It's really well written, no, I really...Congratulations!",2
Céline,"Wait!   Before we go anywhere, I have a...I have to ask you...",2
Jesse,"Sure, what?",2
Céline,"Did you show up in Vienna, that December?",2
Jesse,"  Uh, did you?",2
Céline,"No, I couldn't, but...Did you? I need to know, it's important to me.",2
Jesse,"  Why, if you didn't?",2
Céline,"  Well, did you?",2
Jesse,No.,2
Céline,"Oh, thank God you didn't!   Oh my god!",2
Jesse,"I mean, thank God I didn't, and you didn't! I mean, if one of us had showed up there alone, then that would have sucked.",2
Céline,"I know! I know! I know! I was so concerned with that. I always felt horrible about not being there, but I couldn't! You know, my grandma died a few days before, and she was buried that day, December 16th, that day!",2
Jesse,"She died, the one in Budapest?",2
Céline,"Yes, you remember that?",2
Jesse,"Yeah, I remember everything.",2
Céline,"Of course, it was in your book. But anyway, I was about to fly to Vienna, you know, and I...and we heard the news about her, and of course I took her to the funeral with my parents.",2
Jesse,"Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that.",2
Céline,"I know. But you weren't there anyway.   Wait. Why weren't you there? I would have been there if I could have, I made plans, and...Wait. You‘d better have a good reason!",2
Céline,"What?!   Oh...no! No, you were there, weren't you?   Oh, no, that's terrible!   I know I'm laughing, but I don't mean it! Did you hate me? You must have hated me. Have you been hating me all this time? You have!",2
Jesse,"No, no...",2
Céline,"Yes, you have! Oh, but you can't hate me now, right? I mean, my grandma...",2
Jesse,"I don't hate you, alright? Come on, it's no big deal, alright? I flew all the way over there, you blew the thing off, and then my life has been a big nosedive since then, but I mean it's not a problem.",2
Céline,"No, you can't say that!",2
Jesse,"No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.",2
Céline,"Oh, I can't believe it, you must have been so angry with me... I'm so sorry, I really wanted to be there, more than anything in the world! I swear...Honestly, I swear...I mean, you can't be angry...my grandmother...",2
Jesse,"No, I know, I know, I honestly thought that something like that might have happened. I was definitely bummed, but...Mostly, I was jut mad we hadn't exchanged any phone numbers or any information.",2
Céline,"I know, that was so stupid, no way to get in touch. I didn't even know your last name.",2
Jesse,"I know, we had nothing to go on. I know, I know...remember, I mean we were both afraid that if we started writing and calling, that it would slowly...you know, fade out.",2
Céline,"Yeah, it definitely wasn't a slow fade.",2
Jesse,"No, it sure wasn't.",2
Céline,"I know, we wanted to pick it up were we left off.",2
Jesse,Which would have been fine if it had worked.,2
Céline,"Yes, good idea.",2
Jesse,Oh well.,2
Céline,"  How long were you in Vienna, then?",2
Jesse,Just a couple of days.,2
Céline,Did you meet another girl?,2
Jesse,"Aah, yeah. Her name was Gretchen, and she was amazing.",2
Céline,You did?,2
Jesse,"Yeah, the book is really a composite of the two of you.",2
Céline,"Really? Oh, no!",2
Jesse,"No, I'm kidding! You wouldn't believe it, I even went back to the train station. I put up, you know, signs of my number,   and the hotel, in case you've been delayed. I was a total dork.",2
Céline,Let's go this way. Did you get any calls?,2
Jesse,"Just a couple hookers, looking for a gig. No, it was awful. I mean, what do you want me to say?",2
Céline,"Oh, it's so sad. I'm so sorry!",2
Jesse,"I walked around for a couple of days. Eventually, I flew home, I owed my dad 2000 bucks, who had warned me about French chicks, I have to say.",2
Céline,  What did he tell you about French women?,2
Jesse,"Nothing, the guy... he's never met any French women. He's never been east of the Mississippi.",2
Céline,"So why didn't you put that “six months later, uh, the French bitch didn't have show up.” You know, like...",2
Jesse,"But I did, I did.",2
Céline,You did?,2
Jesse,"Yeah, no, I mean I made it more hopeful. I wrote this whole fictional version in which you actually do show up.",2
Céline,"Oh, what happens?",2
Jesse,"Well, um...",2
Céline,What?,2
Jesse,"Well, we make love for about ten days straight, that's one part of it.",2
Céline,"Oh, that's interesting. So, “the French slut.” Yeah, OK, OK...",2
Jesse,"Yeah, exactly. It's just, then they, you know, they start to get to know each other better and they realize that they don't get along at all.",2
Céline,"Oh, I like that. It's more real.",2
Jesse,"Yeah, well, my editor didn't think that way.",2
Céline,"No, everyone wants to believe in love. It sells, right?",2
Jesse,"Yeah, exactly...so...",2
Céline,"So things are going well for you, right? I mean, your book is a best seller in the U.S.",2
Jesse,It's a TINY best-seller.,2
Céline,"Oh, come on.",2
Jesse,"Alright, yeah right, officially, yes, but I mean most people haven't read Moby Dick, you know, so why should they read my book?",2
Céline,"Well, I haven't read Moby Dick, and I liked your book, so...",2
Jesse,Thanks.,2
Céline,"You know  , I thought you idealized the night a bit.",2
Jesse,"Oh, come on, it's officially fiction.",2
Céline,"No, no, no. No, I know, I know. I know, I thought...You know, there were times when you made me a...well, I mean her, right? No, me...OK, whatever! A little bit neurotic!",2
Jesse,"You are a little bit like that, aren't you?",2
Céline,You think I'm neurotic?,2
Jesse,"No, no, no, come on, I'm kidding! Where did I do that? I didn't do that.",2
Céline,"Well, maybe it's just me. You know, uh, reading something knowing that the character in the story is based on you...it's both...flattering and disturbing at the same time.",2
Jesse,How is it disturbing?,2
Céline,"I don't know, just...being part of someone else's memory. Seeing myself through your eyes. How long did it take you to write it?",2
Jesse,"Um, uh, 3 or 4 years, on and off.",2
Céline,"Wow, that's a really long time to be writing about one night.",2
Jesse,"Yeah, I know, tell me about it.",2
Céline,I always assumed you had forgotten me.,2
Jesse,"No, I had a pretty clear picture of you in my mind. I have to tell you something.   I just...",2
Céline,What?,2
Jesse,"I wanted to talk to you for so long, you know, that now...",2
Céline,"Yeah, me too.",2
Jesse,"It's just surreal, you know, I feel like everything out of my mouth should be...",2
Céline,"I know, I know, how long do we have?   20 minutes and 30 seconds? Let's go!",2
Jesse,"  No, we got more than that. I wanna know about you. Tell me what are you doing...you know, what are you up to?",2
Céline,"Uh, where to start...I, uh, I work for Green Cross. It's an environmental organization.",2
Jesse,"Yeah, what are...what are they all about?",2
Céline,"Well, we basically work on different environment issues, from clean water to disarmament of chemical weapons. You know, international laws that deal with the environment.",2
Jesse,"And, and, what do you do for them?",2
Céline,We're going this way.,2
Jesse,Wow!,2
Céline,"Well, yeah, the cotton industry there is a major source of pollution, so...",2
Jesse,"I mean, this sounds like you're actually doing something, you know, I mean, most people, myself included, just...sit around and bitch, you know. America's consuming all the world’s resources, SUVs suck, global warming is real...",2
Céline,"You know, I'm really relieved to hear you're not one of those Freedom Fries kind of Americans.",2
Jesse,"Hey, you know...But, how did you get into that?",2
Céline,"I came out of political science, and I was hoping to work for the government. And I did, for a little while...ugh, terrible!",2
Jesse,Not good?,2
Céline,"Yeah, no.",2
Jesse,"You know, I always thought you'd be doing something cool like that. I did!",2
Céline,Thanks. I just feel really really lucky to be doing a job I like.,2
Jesse,"Yeah. You know, I actually alternated between thinking that...You know, everything is irrevocably screwed up, and that things might be getting better in some ways.",2
Céline,  Better? How could you possibly say that?,2
Jesse,"Well, I just mean, you know, like...I mean, I know it sounds weird, but there are things to be optimistic about.",2
Céline,"OK...uh, I know your book is selling, which is great, I'm very happy for you, but let me break the news for you, OK? The world is a mess right now!",2
Jesse,I wasn't saying that...,2
Céline,"  I can’t see how you can say things are getting “a bit better.” OK, we're moving all our industry to developing nations. We can get cheap labor free of any environmental laws.",2
Céline,"OK, the weapon industry is booming. Five million people die every year from preventable water disease. So, how is the world getting any better? I'm not getting angry, I'm not getting angry, but come on, I want to know, I'm interested!",2
Jesse,"OK, I realize that there are a lot of serious problems in the world.",2
Céline,"OK  , thank you!",2
Jesse,"  I mean, I don't even have one publisher in the whole Asian market.",2
Céline,"OK, alright.   Say ""stop.""",2
Jesse,"OK, OK, what? ""Stop.""",2
Céline,  OH!,2
Jesse,"  No, look, all I'm saying is that there's more awareness out there, right?   People are going to fight back!",2
Céline,OK.,2
Jesse,"You know, I mean I think the world might be getting better because people like you are educated into speaking out. Even the very notion of conservation, environmental issues, those weren't even in the vocabulary until fairly recently, you know, and now they're becoming a norm, and eventually might be what's expected all over the world.",3
Céline,"I agree with what you're saying, but at the same time, it's dangerous. An imperialist country can use that kind of thinking to justify their economic greed. You know, human rights...",3
Jesse,"Is there a particular imperialistic country you have in mind there, Frenchy?",3
Céline,"  No, not really.",3
Céline,  Bonsoir!,3
Jesse,  Bonsoir.,3
Céline,"So, you want to sit over there?",3
Jesse,"Yeah, this is perfect. Oh, wow, maybe what I'm saying is the world might be evolving the way a person evolves.",3
Jesse,"Right, I mean...me, for example. Am I getting worse? Am I improving? I don't know. When I was younger, I was healthier, but I was, uh, racked with insecurity, you know? Now I'm older, my problems are deeper, but I'm more equipped to handle them.",3
Céline,So what are your problems?,3
Jesse,"  Right now? I don't have any. I don't, you know? Just   damn happy to be here!",3
Céline,"Me too.   So, how long have you been in Paris?",3
Jesse,"I got in last night, I've done 10 cities in 12 days. I'm wrecked. I'm so glad it's over, you know? I'm tired of being a huckster.",3
Céline,  What do you want?,3
Jesse,"Um, a cup of coffee.",3
Céline,"Un café et un citron pressé, s'il vous plait.",3
Jesse,"  God, I love this cafe. I wish they had places like this in the U.S.",3
Céline,"Yeah, I missed cafes when I was living over there. I mean, I find a few places I really liked, but there was...",3
Jesse,  You...You were living in the U.S.?,3
Céline,"Yes, from, uh, '96 to '99. I was studying at NYU.",3
Jesse,"OH, GOD   don't tell me that, Céline!",3
Céline,What?!,3
Jesse,"No, it's just...Nothing, I mean I...",3
Céline,What?,3
Jesse,"I've been living in New York since '98. You know, we were there at the same time!",3
Céline,In New York?,3
Jesse,Yeah.,3
Céline,"Ah, that's weird. It actually crossed my mind a few times that I might run into you, but...The odds are so slim, right? So...I didn't even know what city you were living in. Weren't you somewhere in Texas? You were in Texas.",3
Jesse,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely, I just...I was for a long time, I just...You know, wanted to try New York.",3
Céline,  Wow.,3
Jesse,What brought you back here?,3
Céline,"Uh, I had finished my master’s, for one. And...no visa. No more visa. And, anyway, I was starting to get paranoid. All the violence in the medias. Gang violence, murders. Especially serial killers.   But, the final straw was...one night I heard a...some noise on my fire escape, so I called 911. And the cops came, eventually.",3
Jesse,"Yeah, like 3 hours later.",3
Céline,"Yeah, after I had been raped and killed about 30 times.   No, but...It was a man and a woman officer, and I was explaining to them what I had heard, when the woman had to run downstairs to move the police car. So, I was left alone with the male cop. And right away, he asked me if I had a gun. And I said no, of course not, I...And he told me: ""You better think about getting one. This is America, not France."" OK? And I said to him, you know, I have no idea how to shoot a gun, and I have no interest in firearms, whatsoever. And that's when he pulled out his gun, like this  ...and he went: ""Well, one day...you're gonna have something like THIS in your face, and if you wanna have a long life, you're gonna have to choose...between you...or THEM."" And then they left. And the next morning I called for an application to get a gun.   Me, with a gun! I mean, that's really scary. But then I realized something was wrong, the way that that cop had pulled his gun out, and everything, right?",3
Jesse,"Yeah, sure!",3
Céline,"So I canceled my demand for the gun, and I called the police station, and tried to complain about that cop's behavior, but...",3
Jesse,What happened with that?,3
Céline,"It was so much paperwork...and then I got scared, with my shitty student visa.",3
Jesse,"Yeah, you thought you'd get deported?",3
Céline,"Yeah, exactly! So I gave up and I forgot about the whole thing. Well, I guess I never forgot.",3
Jesse,Well obviously...yeah.,3
Céline,"But, still, you know...I really enjoyed being there. There's a lot of things I miss about the U.S.",3
Jesse,"Yeah, like what?",3
Céline,"Um...well...The overall good mood people have there, like, you know, even if it can be bullshit sometimes. Like   ""How‘re you doin'?"" ""Great!"" ""How’re you doin'?"" ""Great!"" ""Have a great day!""   I don't know...Parisians can be so grumpy, have you noticed?",3
Jesse,"No, everybody seems pretty happy to me.",3
Céline,"  Unh, they're not happy.",3
Jesse,  They're not happy?,3
Céline,"No, they are, I don't know. Maybe I just mean French men. They drive me nuts.",3
Jesse,What is it? What about them?,3
Céline,"Well, they're very nice. They're great, you know, to be around, they love food, wine. They're great cooks. But, I don't know, maybe I've had really bad luck with them, or something.",3
Jesse,Why? What do you mean?,3
Céline,"Um, well...I guess they're not as um...",3
Jesse,What?,3
Céline,What's the word? Um...”horny”? They're not as horny.,3
Jesse,"  Horny? Now alright, well, listen to me on this one, alright, you know. In that regard, I am proud to be an American.",3
Céline,"And you should be, in that regard only.",3
Céline,Merci. Have you ever spent some time in Eastern Europe?,3
Jesse,"Eastern? No, no...",3
Céline,"No? I, uh, remember as a teenager I went to Warsaw, when it was still a strict communist regime. Which I don't approve of at all.",3
Jesse,"  Oh yeah, sure you don't...",3
Céline,"No, I don’t.",3
Jesse,"No, I'm just kidding!",3
Céline,"But, anyway, something about being there was very interesting, I found. After a couple of weeks, something changed in me. The city was quite gloomy and gray and...but, after a while, my brain seemed clearer. I was writing a lot more in my journal, ideas I had never thought of before.",3
Jesse,Communist ideas?,3
Céline,"Listen, I'm not...",3
Jesse,"I'm sorry, I can't...Go on!",3
Céline,"I'll send you to a Gulag! No...but it took me a while to figure out why it felt, you know, so different. And then, one day, as I was walking through the Jewish cemetery, I don't know why, but it occurred to me there, I realized that I had spent the last 2 weeks away from most of my habits. TV was in a language I didn't understand. There was nothing to buy, no advertisements anywhere. So, all I've been doing was...walk around, think, and write. My brain felt like it was at rest, free from the consuming frenzy. And I have to say, it was almost like a natural high. I felt so peaceful inside, no...strange urge to be somewhere else, to shop...Maybe it could have seemed like boredom at first, but it quickly became very, very soulful. It's interesting, you know?",3
Jesse,Can you believe that it was 9 years ago that we were walking around Vienna?,3
Céline,9 years? No that's impossible.,3
Jesse,"It was, I know, it feels like 2 months ago to me, but it was summer '94.",3
Céline,  Do we look any different?   I do.,3
Jesse,  I'd have to see you naked.,3
Céline,  What?,3
Jesse,"I'm sorry. Your hair was different back then, it was like...",3
Céline,"What, it's the same.",3
Jesse,"Yeah, take it down, let's see!",3
Céline,"Down, it was down. OK.   Well, voila!   So? OK, come on, tell me.",3
Jesse,"Uh...skinnier, I think,   a little thinner.",3
Céline,Did you think I was fat before?,3
Jesse,No.,3
Céline,"Yeah, you thought I was a fatty. No, you thought I was a fatty. Yeah, you wrote a book about a fat French girl! Oh, no!",3
Jesse,"No, listen. Seriously, alright, you look beautiful. Do I look any different?",3
Céline,"No. Not at all, although actually,   you have this line.",3
Jesse,I know.,3
Céline,Looks like a scar.,3
Jesse,"  A SCAR? What, like a gunshot wound?",3
Céline,"No, no, no, I lied to you, I'm sorry. I had this funny...well, horrible dream the other day. I was having this awful nightmare, that I was 32, and then I woke up, and I was 23, so relieved! And then I woke up for real, and I was 32. Scary!",3
Jesse,It happens.,3
Céline,"Yeah, time goes faster and faster. Apparently, it's because we don't renew our synapses after 20. So, it's pretty much downhill from then on. Oh well.",3
Jesse,"I like getting older, you know, it feels...I don't know, it feels more immediate. You know, like I can appreciate things more.",3
Céline,"No, me too, actually. I really love it.",3
Jesse,I was once a... ...a drummer in a band.,3
Céline,You were?,3
Jesse,"Yeah, we were pretty good, actually. But then...the lead singer guy, he was just so obsessed with us getting a record deal.   You know, it's all we talked about, it was all we thought about, getting bigger shows, and everything was just...focused on the future, all the time. And now, the band doesn't even exist anymore, right? And looking back at the...at the shows we did play, even rehearsing...you know,   it was just so much fun! Now I'd be able to enjoy every minute of it. Can I have a drag?",3
Céline,"Well, your book has been published, that's... that's a pretty big deal, and you've been all around Europe with it. Are you enjoying every minute of it?",3
Jesse,  Not really...,3
Céline,Not really?,3
Jesse,Do you have another one of those?,3
Céline,"Yes, of course.   Um, here.   In my field, I see these people that...  ...uh, sorry...come into it with big idealist visions of becoming the new leader that will create a better world. They enjoy the goal, but not the process!",3
Jesse,Right.,3
Céline,"But the reality of it is that the true work of improving things is in the little achievements of the day. And that's what you need to enjoy, just in that field.",3
Jesse,"What, what do you mean, exactly?",3
Céline,"Well, for example, I was working for this organization that helped villages in Mexico. And their concerns was how to get the pencils sent to the kid in these little country schools. I was not about big revolutionary ideas, it was about pencils. I see the people that do the real work and what's really sad, in a way, is that...the people that are the most giving, hard working and capable of making this world better, usually don't have the ego and ambition to be a leader. They don't see any interest in superficial rewards, they don't care if...if their name ever appear in the press. They actually enjoy the process of helping others, they're in the moment.",3
Jesse,"Yeah, but that's so hard! You know, to be in the moment. I just feel like I'm...designed to be slightly dissatisfied with everything. You know? I mean, like...always trying to better my situation. You know, I satisfy one desire, and it just... agitates another, you know? Then I think, to hell with it, right? I mean, desire is the fuel of life, I mean, do you think it's true that if we never wanted anything, we'd never be unhappy?",3
Céline,"I don't know... Not wanting anything, isn't that... a symptom of depression? Yeah, that is, right? I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?",3
Jesse,"Yeah... I don't know, I mean, it's what all those Buddhist guys say, right? You know, liberate yourself from desire and you'll find that you already have everything you need.",3
Céline,"Yeah, but I feel really alive when I want something more than just basic survival needs. I mean, wanting whether it's intimacy with another person, or a new pair of shoes, is kind of beautiful. I like that we have those ever-renewing desires.",3
Jesse,"Well, maybe it's just a sense of entitlement. You know, like whenever you feel like you deserve that new pair of shoes, you know. It's OK to want things as long as you don't get pissed off if you don't get 'em. Right? Life's hard. It's supposed to be. If we didn't suffer, we wouldn't learn a thing, you know?",3
Céline,"So, what? Are you a Buddhist or something?",3
Jesse,No.,3
Céline,No? Why not?,3
Jesse,"I don't know, uh...Same reason I don't consider myself anything, really.",3
Céline,"Yeah, I know. I decided a long time ago that I was gonna be open to everything, but, not buy into any one-and-only belief system.",3
Jesse,"I went to this, uh, Trappist monastery, a couple of years ago.",3
Céline,Trappist?,3
Jesse,"Yeah, they're Catholics, Cistercians.",3
Céline,Why did you do that?,3
Jesse,"Why? I had just been doing some reading, I guess... I don't know, I thought it'd be cool. Have you ever spent any time with any monks and nuns?",3
Céline,No. It's not really my style.,3
Jesse,"No? I expected them to be all glowering and stern, you know, but they weren't. They were really quick to laugh, really easy to be around. Seriously, very attuned to everything. They were just, uh...you know, they weren't trying to hustle anybody. They're trying to live and die, in peace with God, you know, or whatever part of them they feel is eternal. It was just so refreshing to be around. You know, you realize that most of the people that you meet are trying to get somewhere better, you know, they're trying to make a little bit more cash, trying to get a little more respect, have more people admire them, you know. It's just exhausting.",3
Céline,"Yeah, no kidding.",3
Jesse,"You know, it's exhausting to be one of those people yourself, you know? I mean, there I...there I am, right, you know, all greedy to be more spiritual, you know, I wanna be a better person, you know? You can't escape.",3
Céline,"I had this...this boyfriend of mine, many years ago, that wanted to be a Buddhist, and...so he went to Asia to visit some of those monasteries.",3
Jesse,"Yeah, I thought about doing that, too.",3
Céline,"Yeah, you should. I'll tell you why. Ah, he was quite good looking, and, each time he went to one of those monasteries, a monk offered to suck his cock.   True story!",3
Jesse,"Well, it all comes down to that, doesn't it? I mean, I think that's why I really admire what you're doing, you know?",3
Céline,"What do you mean, sucking cock?",3
Jesse,"Ah, NO. I was gonna say, uh...you know, you're not detached from life. You know, you're putting your passion into action.",3
Céline,"Well, I try.",3
Jesse,"  Hey, you know something, I'm...I'm gonna be on planes, and like, in an airport for the next 8 hours. I'd just love to...to see a little bit more of Paris. Would you walk around with me a little bit?",3
Céline,"Yeah, yeah, let's do that!",3
Jesse,Do you mind?,3
Céline,"No, no, no, that's great!",3
Jesse,Do you want to?,3
Céline,"Let’s do that. Yeah, yeah, that's great!",3
Jesse,"What do we owe here? 4,50.   No, no, I got it, I got it. I got a little per diem going on here. Is this good for like a tip?",3
Céline,"Yeah, that's fine. That's more than enough.",3
Jesse,"Alright, is there anywhere to go around here?",3
Céline,"  Uh, it's sales day, today!",3
Jesse,  What's that?,3
Céline,"It's when everything is on sale in Paris. It's twice a year.   Au revoir, merci!",3
Jesse,"  Au revoir, merci! Alright, let's go shopping!",3
Céline,"  No, no, no, no, that's a bad idea. I don't want to inflict that on you. It's madness. Let's just go on this garden path.",3
Jesse,Alright.,3
Céline,It's really nice.,3
Céline,Scene IV – Garden Walk A La Promenade Plantée,4
Jesse,"Alright, that sounds better than shopping, actually. I mean, not that I wouldn't do whatever you wanted.",4
Céline,"You know, sometimes I don't even need to buy anything. I just get high on trying on and looking at things.",4
Jesse,"Yeah, well a therapist would tell you...Is this where we're going?",4
Céline,Yeah!,4
Jesse,A therapist would tell you it's all good.,4
Céline,Really?,4
Jesse,Yeah.,4
Céline,Are you ever in therapy?,4
Jesse,"Oh, no. Do I seem like I'm in therapy?",4
Céline,  I'm kidding. Has it helped your sex problems?,4
Jesse,My SEX problems?,4
Céline,"No, I'm kidding.",4
Jesse,"No, c’mon, tell me the truth. I mean, we didn't have any problems that night.",4
Céline,"No, I'm kidding!   We didn't even have sex, anyway.",4
Jesse,"But, that's a joke, right?",4
Céline,"No, we didn't! I mean, that was the whole thing.",4
Jesse,"No, of course we did!",4
Céline,"No, no, no, no, we didn't. You didn't have a condom, and I never have sex without one. Especially on a one night thing. I mean, I'm extremely paranoid about my health. There's no way I would have...",4
Jesse,"  Whoa, I find this very scary that you don't remember what happened.",4
Céline,"What?   No, listen, OK...I didn't write an entire book, but I kept a journal, OK? And I wrote the whole night in it. That's what I mean, you idealizing the night!",4
Jesse,"Alright, listen! I even remember what brand of condom we used.",4
Céline,"OK, that's disgusting. I don't want to hear it!",4
Jesse,It's not disgusting.,4
Céline,"OK, you know what, when I get home, I'll check my journal from '94, but I know I'm right!   Wait a minute...",4
Jesse,What?,4
Céline,Was it in the cemetery?,4
Jesse,"No...no, we went to the cemetery in the afternoon, it was in a park. VERY late at night? In the park.",4
Céline,  Wait a minute.,4
Jesse,  I can’t I can’t,4
Céline,  No,4
Jesse,"Is it that forgettable? I mean, you really don't remember...  in the park!",4
Céline,"OK, wait a minute. I...I think you might be right.",4
Jesse,"Alright now, you're messing with me, now. Are you messing with me?",4
Céline,"OK, no, I'm sorry! I think you...I mean, you're right, OK? Sometimes, I put things in drawers inside my head, and forget about it.   I guess it's less painful to put certain things away than to live with it! I'm sorry!",4
Jesse,So that...that night was a sad memory for you?,4
Céline,"No, I didn't mean that night in particular. I just meant certain things are better off forgotten.",4
Jesse,I remember that night better than I do entire years.,4
Céline,Me too.,4
Jesse,  Really?,4
Céline,"Well, I thought I did...But, maybe I...Maybe I put it away because of the fact that...my grandmother's funeral was the day we were supposed to meet again.",4
Jesse,"Yeah, right, it was a tough day for me, but it must have been worse for you.",4
Céline,"It was unreal. I remember looking at her dead body in the coffin.   Her beautiful hands so warm, so sweet, that used to hold me, that...Nothing in that coffin resembled what I remembered of her. All the warmth was gone. Then I was crying...so confused if I was crying because I was never gonna see her again and never gonna see...  you again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to go on like this, I've been a little down this week, I don't know.",4
Jesse,Why?,4
Céline,"I don't know, nothing bad, just... reading your book, maybe? No, but...thinking about how hopeful I was that summer and fall, and since then it's been kind of a...I don't know. Memory is a wonderful thing, if you don't have to, uh, deal with the past.",4
Jesse,"“Memory is a wonderful thing, if you don't have to deal with the past.” Can I put that on a bumper sticker? No, you know what? If you wrote a book about our night, that would be a good title!",4
Céline,"Yeah, it could be a totally different book.",4
Jesse,"Yeah, there'd be no sex scenes.",4
Céline,But you know what?,4
Jesse,What?,4
Céline,"Now that we've met again, we can change our memory of that December 16th.  It no longer has that sad ending of us never seeing each other again. Right?",4
Jesse,"Yeah, you’re right. I guess a memory is never finished. As long as you're alive...",4
Céline,"Yeah, I know. I have this memory from my childhood, that I realized recently, never happened.",4
Jesse,What?,4
Céline,"Well, when I was 8 or 9, my mom was so paranoid when I was walking home, from my piano lesson at night. She would always warn me about dirty old men, giving me candies, and then showing me their peepees. She was so obsessed with it, that later in life, you know, I had...I had this image in my head that this really happened. To the point that I even associated sex with that walk home. I mean, sometimes, even now, when I'm...  when I'm when I’m having sex, I see myself walking down that street. I swear!   It's so weird, right?",4
Jesse,"Well, is that street nearby? I mean, could...",4
Céline,NO.   Very far. Did you ever keep a journal when you were a kid?,4
Jesse,"Um, yeah...On and off, I guess.",4
Céline,"It's funny, I read a...one of mine from '83, the other day.",4
Jesse,Yeah?,4
Céline,"And, what really surprised me, is that I was feeling with life, the same way am now. I was much more hopeful and naive, but the core, and the way I was feeling things, is exactly the same. It made me realize I haven't changed much at all.",4
Jesse,"Yeah, I don't think anybody does; people don't want to admit it, but it's like we just...we have these innate set points.",4
Céline,Uh-huh.,4
Jesse,"You know, it's like...nothing much that happens to us changes our disposition.",4
Céline,"Really, you believe that?",4
Jesse,"I think so. I read this study where they followed people who had won the lottery, and people who had become paraplegics, right. I mean you'd think that...you know, one extreme is gonna make you...euphoric, and the other suicidal. But the study shows that after about 6 months",4
Céline,Uhum?,4
Jesse,"Right...as soon as people got used to their new situation, they were more or less the same.",4
Céline,The same?,4
Jesse,"Well, yeah...Like if they were basically an optimistic, jovial person, they're now an optimistic, jovial person, in a wheelchair. If they're a petty miserable asshole, OK, they're a petty miserable asshole with a new Cadillac, a house and a boat.",4
Céline,"So, you’ll now be forever depressed, no matter what great things happen in my life?",4
Jesse,Definitely.,4
Céline,Great!,4
Jesse,"No, c’mon...Are you depressed now?",4
Céline,"No, no, I'm not depressed. But, sometimes I worry that I'll get to the end of my life feeling I haven't done all I've all I wanted to do.",4
Jesse,"Oh, what do you wanna do?",4
Céline,"  I, um, I want to paint more, I wanna...play my guitar everyday, I wanna learn Chinese, I wanna write more songs...There're so many things I wanna do, and end up doing not much.",4
Jesse,"  Alright well, well let me ask you this: do you believe in, like... ghosts or spirits?",4
Céline,"Um, no.",4
Jesse,No?,4
Céline,No.,4
Jesse,"OK, uh, what about reincarnation?",4
Céline,Not at all.,4
Jesse,God?,4
Céline,"No.   That sounds that sounds terrible. No, no, no. But, at the same time I don't wanna be one of those people that don't believe in any kind of magic, you know.",4
Jesse,"So then, astrology.",4
Céline,"Yes, of course!",4
Jesse,"There we go, right!",4
Céline,"I mean, that makes sense, right? You're a Scorpio, I'm a Sag, so we get along.   No! No, no There's a an Einstein quote I really, really like. He said, um: ""If you don't believe in any kind of magic, or mystery, you’re basically as good as dead.""",4
Jesse,"Yeah, I like that. I've always felt there was some kind of mystical core to the universe. You know that More recently, I started to think that...that me...you know, my personality, whatever, that...I don't have any permanent place here. You know, in eternity, or whatever, you know. And the more I think that, I can't go through life saying that this is no big deal, you know.   I mean, this is it! This is actually happening. What do you... think is interesting, what do you think is funny, what do you think is important? You know, every day is our last.",4
Céline,"When I feel that way, I...usually call my mom to tell her how much I love her.",4
Jesse,Yeah.,4
Céline,"And she's always: ""Are you OK? Do you have cancer?   Are you going to commit suicide?"" It's almost not worth it.   So, uh So what about us?",4
Jesse,What about us?,4
Céline,"No, what I mean is, if we were both going to die, tonight",4
Jesse,"What, like if the Apocalypse was coming?",4
Céline,"No, no, that's too dramatic. But, what if... you know, just the two of us were going to die. I mean, would we talk about your book, the environment or...",4
Jesse,If today was our last day?,4
Céline,"Yeah, what would we talk about, what would you tell me, for example?",4
Jesse,Well...,4
Céline,That's hard.,4
Jesse,"No, I'll do it, I'll do it. I definitely... would stop talking about my book. I have to admit I would probably drop the environment. But, I would still...want to talk about, you know, magic and the universe. I'd just wanna do it from a...",4
Céline,What?,4
Jesse,"...a hotel room. You know? In between sessions of us, uh wildly fucking, until we die.",4
Céline,"Wow?! Well, why waste time with an hotel room? Why not do it right there   on a bench?",4
Jesse,"  Come here, come here...",4
Céline,No!   OK. We're not gonna die tonight. OK?,4
Jesse,"Alright, too bad.",4
Jesse,Céline. Yeah.,4
Jesse,I'm sorry.,4
Céline,  That was an extreme example.,4
Jesse,I'm sorry.,4
Céline,"OK. What I...My point was, you know, to truly communicate with people is very hard to do.",4
Jesse,"No, I know, I mean most of our...most of our day to day exchanges",4
Céline,"Yeah, I know, I mean... not to bring everything back to sex.",4
Jesse,"But, why not?",4
Céline,"No, no, this example, this friend of mine, she...she was talking about..she and her boyfriend problems in bed.",4
Jesse,Right?,4
Céline,"And, uh, how when, they had been dating for a year, she started telling him what he could do to please her more. And it totally freaked him out.",4
Jesse,Why?,4
Céline,"Totally. Well, he felt all threatened and he thought he was a bad lover.",4
Jesse,"Maybe she shouldn't have waited so long. You know, after a year",4
Céline,"Well, yeah, but, men are so easily offended!",4
Jesse,"Oh, what, more than women, you think?",4
Céline,"Oh, definitely on that subject!",4
Jesse,You think so?,4
Céline,"Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, maybe it's because, you know...men are...easier to...you know...to please.",4
Jesse,  To please?,4
Céline,"Well, I don't know...",4
Jesse,"Yeah, they are, they definitely...definitely.",4
Céline,"Anyway, this friend of mine, she was telling me that, um, next time she dates another man, she's gonna make a little questionnaire, about what they like and dislike, before they even...",4
Jesse,"Oh, like written down, or out loud?",4
Céline,"Yeah, yeah, written down, mostly written down. But it wouldn't be just...you know, yes or no, it would be a little more complex than that. Like for example, if the question is: ""Are you into S&M?"" The answer could be, ""No, but, a good spanking once in a while doesn't hurt.""   Right?",4
Jesse,"Right. Or like, uh, what, ""So do you like talking dirty in bed?"" That kind of thing?",4
Céline,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but not just like...any dirty talk. Just like: ""What specific word would you like to hear?"" You know, like...",4
Jesse,"What, me?",4
Céline,"Well, yeah. Like, for example, like what specific word would you like to hear?",4
Jesse,I don't know...,4
Céline,"Um...what do you feel about the word ""Pussy""?",4
Jesse,I...LOVE IT.,4
Céline,Good.   It's amazing what...perverts we've become in the past 9 years.,4
Jesse,"I know, I know. Well, at least now we don't have to pretend that each new sexual experience is like a life-altering event.",4
Céline,"I know, by now, I know you've stuck it in so many places, it's like, about to fall off.",4
Jesse,"I mean, you know, I can't realistically expect you to have become anything but a total ho’, at this point.",4
Céline,"Yeah, thank you.",4
Jesse,"  No, I'm sor...",4
Céline,"That's true, what can you do?",4
Jesse,What can you do?   So...what kind of songs do you write? I didn't know you did that.,4
Céline,What kind?,4
Jesse,"Yeah, sure.",4
Céline,"I don't know, just songs. Like some are about, you know, people, um, relationships. One's about my cat.",4
Jesse,Sing one! Just...,4
Céline,"No, I can't, I don't have a guitar.",4
Jesse,"Oh, I mean, come on, a capella.",4
Céline,"No, no, no. No, no, no, I'm not singing a song without a guitar, you're nuts!",4
Jesse,  Why not?,4
Céline,"No, OK, not now.",4
Jesse,One!,4
Céline,No.,4
Jesse,"If not now, when? You want to meet here in six months, with a guitar? You know, I'll fly all they way over here, you may or may not make the metro...",4
Céline,"OK, that's... that's funny. That’s really no   We've got to get going back to the bookstore!",4
Jesse,"  What, we’ve got",4
Céline,"You'll miss your flight. Come on, let's go!",4
Jesse,"Alright, alright.",4
Céline,"We can walk down la Seine. It's it’s a nice thing.   So, you're flying back to New York?",4
Jesse,"Yeah, yeah.",4
Céline,"So I read in that article that you're married, with a kid. That's great!",4
Jesse,"Yeah, he's um He's 4.",4
Céline,"Uhum, what's his name?",4
Jesse,"Henry. Little Hank, he's so much fun.",4
Céline,"Oh, wow, I'm sure.   And, your wife, what does she do?",4
Jesse,She teaches elementary school. Do you do you have kids?,4
Céline,"Yes, two Shit!",4
Jesse,What?,4
Céline,"I left them in the car! With the windows up, it was 6 months ago.   No, I'm kidding.   No, but um...  I want to have kids someday, I'm just not ready, yet.",4
Jesse,  Yeah?,4
Céline,"Yeah, I'm in a good relationship, though.",4
Jesse,"Oh, yeah? That's good.",4
Céline,Yeah.,4
Jesse,What's he do?,4
Céline,"He's a photojournalist. He does, uh, war coverage. He's away a lot, which in a way is good for me, because I'm so busy.",4
Jesse,"Yeah, but isn't it dangerous? I mean, aren't a lot of those guys getting killed these days?",5
Céline,He promises me he doesn't take risks.   But I often worry. He goes in this trance when he starts to photograph some things.,5
Jesse,What do you mean?,5
Céline,"Well, once we were in New Delhi and we passed a bum, that was lying down the sidewalk",5
Jesse,A “bom”?,5
Céline,A bum! A homeless...,5
Jesse,"A bum  , alright.",5
Céline,"Anyway, like, he looked like he needed help, but his first reaction was to photograph him. He went, like, really close to his face, fixing his collar, to make it look better. He was like totally detached from the person.",5
Jesse,"Yeah, but don’t you have to be like that to be good at that job?",5
Céline,"Yeah, I mean, I'm not...you know, I'm not...I'm not judging him for it, you know? What he does is essential and incredible. All I'm saying is I could never do it.",5
Jesse,  Let's get on that boat! Come on!,5
Céline,No!,5
Jesse,"No, come on, it will be fun!",5
Céline,You don't have time! We gotta go.,5
Jesse,"It's just about to take off. Look, I've got... I've got...15 more minutes...um, do you have a cell phone?",5
Céline,Yeah.,5
Jesse,"Alright, look, I got that...that driver guy's number, and I can call him, and then they... can pick us up at wherever the next stop is.",5
Céline,"OK, you know I've never been on these boats, it's for tourists, it's embarrassing!",5
Jesse,C’mon.,5
Céline,"OK, alright.   Ahh, c’est bon? On peut rentrées?     Deux tickets, s'il vous plait!",5
Jesse,"No, I'll get it, I'll get it.",5
Céline,"Non, non, c'est bon, j’ai de l’argent!",5
Jesse,"Alright, alright, alright.",5
Céline,  C'est ou qu'il s'arrete le prochain arrete?,5
Jesse,"So, you're in love with that guy?",5
Céline,What guy?,5
Jesse,The... the war photographer.,5
Céline,"Yes, of course.   Merci.",5
Jesse,"  Merci.   I'm sorry, do you...do you have that cell phone?",5
Céline,"Oh, yeah. OK.",5
Jesse,"  Alright, what do I tell him?",5
Céline,"Yeah, tell him to pick you up at ""Quai Henri IV""",5
Jesse,"Oh, shit. At ""Que...""",5
Céline,"Henri quatre, Quai Henri quatre...HEN-RI QUA-TRE...   What's wrong with you? No, do you want me to...Henri quatre.",5
Jesse,Henry four?,5
Céline,Yes!,5
Jesse,"Come on, why didn't you say so?",5
Céline,I'm sorry!,5
Jesse,"  Yes, is this Philippe? Yeah, Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace...uh yeah. Listen, I'm...I'm ah, on one of those boats, right? Um and we're gonna arrive at...uh...Henry Four...at Port Henry Four, you know, you know what that is? Alright, gre...And you have my bags, right? Yeah, so will be there in...I don't know it's the next stop. OK. Au revoir.",5
Céline,OK?,5
Jesse,"Yeah, yeah.",5
Jesse,"  Oh, wow! Notre Dame...man, check that out!",5
Céline,"Oh, wow!",5
Jesse,"I heard this story once, about when the...the Germans were occupying Paris and they had to retreat back, they wired Notre Dame to blow. But they had to...they had to leave one guy in charge of hitting the switch and the guy, the soldier, he...he couldn't do it. You know, he just sat there, knocked out by how beautiful the place was. And then, when the Allied troops came in, they found all the explosives just lying there...and the switch unturned and they found the same thing at...Sacre Coeur...Eiffel Tower...a couple of other places, I think.",5
Céline,Is that true?,5
Jesse,"I don't know... I always liked the story, though.",5
Céline,"Yeah, that's a great story. But you have to think that Notre Dame will be gone one day. There used to be another church or cathedral at the same...right there.",5
Jesse,"What, right in the same spot?",5
Céline,"Yeah. Yeah, this is great, I've never done this!",5
Jesse,Yeah.,5
Céline,I forget about how beautiful Paris is.,5
Jesse,"It's not so bad being a tourist, you know.",5
Céline,Thank you for getting me on the boat.,5
Jesse,"Well, you're welcome. You know, I think that book that I wrote, in a way, was like building something. So that I wouldn't forget the details of the time that we spent together. You know like, just as a reminder that...that once we really did meet, you know, that this was real. This happened.",5
Céline,"I’m happy you’re saying that because...I mean, I always feel like a freak because I'm never able to move on like   this! You know? People just have an affair or even...entire relationships...they break up and they forget! They move on like they would have changed brand of cereals! I feel I was never able to forget anyone I've been with. Because each person have...their own specific qualities. You can never replace anyone. What is lost is lost.",5
Céline,Each relationship when it ends really damages me; I never fully recover. That's why I'm very careful with getting involved because...it hurts too much! Even getting laid - I actually don't do that. I will miss of the person the most mundane things. Like I'm obsessed with little things.,5
Céline,"Maybe I'm crazy, but...when I was a little girl, my mom told me that I was always late to school. One day she followed me to see why. I was looking at chestnuts falling from the trees rolling on the sidewalk or...ants crossing the road...the way a leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk...little things. I think it's the same with people. I see in them little details so specific to each of them that move me and that I miss, and...will always miss. You can never replace anyone, because everyone is made of such beautiful specific details.",5
Jesse,"Alright, now I know for sure. You wanna know why I wrote that stupid book?",5
Céline,Why?,5
Jesse,"So that you might come to a reading in Paris, and I could walk up to you and ask, ""Where the fuck were you?""",5
Céline,"  No, you think I'd be here today?",5
Jesse,"I'm serious, I think I...I wrote it in a way to try to find you.",5
Céline,"OK, that's... I know that's not true, but that's sweet of you to say it.",5
Jesse,I think it is true. What do you think the chances were of us ever meeting again?,5
Céline,"After that December I'd say almost zero. If we're not real anyway, right? We're just...characters in that old lady's dream. She's on her death bed fantasizing about her youth...so of course we have to meet again!",5
Jesse,"Oh, God!   Why weren't you there in Vienna?",5
Céline,  I told you why!,5
Jesse,"Well, I know why, I just   I wish you would've been! Our lives might have been so much different!",5
Céline,You think so?,5
Jesse,I actually do...,5
Céline,"Maybe not, maybe we would have hated each other, eventually.",5
Jesse,"Oh, what, like we hate each other now?",5
Céline,"  You know, maybe we're...we're only good at brief encounters, walking around in European cities, in warm climate!",5
Jesse,"Oh, God, why didn't we exchange phone numbers and stuff? Why didn't we do that?",5
Céline,  Because we were young and stupid?,5
Jesse,You think we still are?,5
Céline,I guess when you're young...you just believe there'll be many people with whom you'll connect with. Later in life you realize it only happens a few times.,5
Jesse,"Yeah, you can screw it up! You know, misconnect...",5
Céline,"  Well, the past is the past. It was meant to be that way.",5
Jesse,"What, you really believe that? That everything is fated?",5
Céline,"Well, you know, the world might be less free than we think.",5
Jesse,Yeah?,5
Céline,"Yeah, when given this exact circumstances, that's what will happen every time.  Two part hydrogen, one part oxygen, you'll get water every time.",5
Jesse,"No, no...no, I mean, what if your grandmother had lived a week longer, you know? Or passed away a week earlier, days even, you know. Things might have been different, I believe that!",5
Céline,"No, you can't think like that.",5
Jesse,"I mean...I know you shouldn't on most things, but...it's just...on this one it seemed like something was off! You know, I mean...in the months leading up to my wedding, OK, I was thinking about you all the time. I mean, even on my way there. I'm in the car, and a buddy of mine is driving me downtown, and I'm staring out the window, and I think I see you - not far from the church, right – folding up an umbrella and walking into a deli on the corner of...13th and Broadway. And I thought I was going crazy, you know? But now I think it probably was you.",5
Céline,  I lived on 11th and Broadway.,5
Jesse,You see?,5
Céline,"So,   what is it like to be married? You haven't talked much about that.",5
Jesse,"I haven't?   How weird?! I don't know, we met...you know when I was in college...and uh we broke up and got back together, for a period of years, and then...um what we were sort of back together, and she was pregnant...so, marriage.",5
Céline,What is she like?,5
Jesse,"She's a great teacher, a good mom. Ahh, she's smart...pretty...I remember thinking at the time, that so many of the men that I admired most, you know, that their lives were...were dedicated to something greater than themselves.",5
Céline,So you got married because men you admired were married?,5
Jesse,"No, no, it...it's more like I have this...this idea of my best self! You know? And I wanted to pursue that...even if it might have been overriding my honest self! You know what I'm saying? I mean, it's funny like...in the moment I remember thinking that it didn't much matter the ""Who?"" of it all...I mean that that nobody is gonna be everything to you...and that ultimately it's just a simple action of committing yourself, you know meeting your responsibilities that...that matters. I mean what is love, right, if it's not respect, trust, admiration and I...I felt all those things! So cut to the present tense, and I feel like I'm running a small nursery with somebody I...used to date, you know. I mean, I'm like a monk, you know. I mean, I've had sex less than...10 times in the last 4 years.   What? What, what? Are you laughing at me?",5
Céline,No.,5
Jesse,It sounds pathetic?,5
Céline,"What monastery do the monks have sex uh, 10 times?",5
Jesse,"OK, I'm doing better than most monks, alright? But I do, I feel like if somebody were to touch me, you know, I would   dissolve into molecules.",5
Céline,"Well, we're here.   We've gotta go. Come on.",5
Jesse,  Shit!,5
Céline,  Bonsoir!,5
Jesse,Bonsoir.,5
Céline,"I'm sorry, uh... to hear that.",5
Jesse,What?,5
Céline,"You know, that you're not that happy with your marriage. Well, this friend of mine, she's a shrink, and uh...",5
Jesse,Yeah? How's she doing?,5
Céline,"She's a mess, but...no, she was telling me that she's been dealing with a lot of couples that are breaking up for the same exact reason.",5
Jesse,"Uhum, what reason is that?",5
Céline,"Well, all these couples expected after a few years of living together for the passion, that consuming desire, to be the same as in the beginning.",5
Jesse,Yeah right.,5
Céline,It's impossible!,5
Jesse,"No, I know, I know that...",5
Céline,"I mean, God, otherwise we would end up with an aneurysm if we were in that constant state of excitement, right? We would end up doing nothing at all with our lives. Do you think you would you would have finished your book, if...if you were fucking somebody every 5 minutes?",5
Jesse,I might have welcomed the challenge.,5
Céline,"But, you know it's not true, for your wife after the birth of your son...she has to give all her love to the little one!",5
Jesse,Of course of course.,5
Céline,"Imagine that she was totally obsessed with sex, right, and you’re like a wild cat...that wouldn't make any sense, right?",5
Jesse,Everything you say makes sense! It's...it's not about sex. I...,5
Céline,"No, I know, it's...obvious. I...You know, couples are so confused, uh lately. I think it must be that...men need to feel essential, and they don't anymore. Because it's been imprinted in their heads for so many years that they had to be the provider...like I, I'm a strong independent woman in my professional life. I don't need a man to feed me but I still need a man to love me and that I could love, you know.   So, uh...your driver's here. Well, I guess this is goodbye, and...uh, you'd better give me your...",5
Jesse,"No, no...why don't we just give you a ride home, wherever you're going. Huh?",5
Céline,"Well, I can take the Metro...",5
Jesse,"No, no, no. My flight it's not until 10, right? They’ve got me arriving two hours early. This way we can keep talking. No, no no   Monsieur...can",5
Céline,  Ca vous arrive me deposer au passage 18 rue des Petites Ecuries?,5
Jesse,Oui.,5
Céline,D’accord. Ce n'est pas de probleme pas?,5
Céline,Vous pouvez me laissez au metro...au metro Chateau d'Eau. Ca ira tres bien.,5
Céline,Merci!,5
Jesse,You told him where you are and all that shit?,5
Céline,"Oui, oui, yeah.",5
Jesse,"So, he knows where he's going?",5
Céline,Yes.,5
Jesse,"Glad somebody does. Now, this is better than the Metro, right?",6
Céline,Definitely!,6
Céline,"I was thinking...for me it's better I don't romanticize things as much anymore. I was suffering so much all the time. I still have lots of dreams, but they're not in regard to my love life.   It doesn't make me sad, it's just the way it is.",6
Jesse,Is that why you're in a relationship with somebody who's never around?,6
Céline,"Yes, obviously, I can't deal with the day to day life of a relationship. Yeah, we have, you know, this exciting time together and then he leaves, and I miss him, but at least I'm not dying inside. When someone is always around me, I'm like suffocating!",6
Jesse,"No, wait, you just said that you need to love and be loved...",6
Céline,"Yeah, but when I do it quickly makes me nauseous! It's a disaster... I mean I'm really happy only when I'm on my own. Even being alone...it's better than...sitting next to a lover and feeling lonely. It's not so easy for me to be all romantic. You start off that way and after you've been screwed over a few times...you...you you forget about all your delusional ideas and you just take what comes into your life. That's not even true I haven't been...screwed over, I've just had too many blah relationships. They weren't mean, they cared for me, but... there were no real...connection or excitement. At least not from my side.",6
Jesse,"God, I'm sorry, is it...is it really that bad? It's not, right?",6
Céline,"  You know...it's not even that. I was...I was fine, until I read your fucking book! It stirred shit up, you know? It reminded me how genuinely romantic I was, how I had so much hope in things, and now it's like...I don't believe in anything that relates to love. I don't feel things for people anymore. In a way...I put all my romanticism into that one night, and I was never able to feel all this again. Like...somehow this night took things away from me and...I expressed them to you, and you took them with you! It made me feel cold, like if love wasn't for me!",6
Jesse,I... I don't believe that. I don't believe that.,6
Céline,"You know what? Reality and love are almost contradictory for me. It's funny...every single of my ex’s...they're now married! Men go out with me, we break up, and then they get married! And later they call me to thank me for teaching them what love is, and",6
Jesse,  Oh God.,6
Céline, and that I taught them to care and respect women!,6
Jesse,  I think I'm one of those guys.,6
Céline,"  You know, I want to KILL them!! Why didn't they ask ME to marry them? I would have said ""No"", but at least they could have asked!! But it's my fault, I know it's my fault, because...I never felt it was the right man. Never! But what does it mean the right man? The love of your life? The concept is absurd; the idea that we can only be complete with another person is...EVIL!! RIGHT??!!",6
Jesse,  Can I talk?,6
Céline,"  You know, I guess I've been heartbroken too many times. And then I recovered. So now, you know, from the starts I make no effort because I know it’s not going to work out, I know it’s not going to work out.",6
Jesse,"You can't do that. You can't do that, you can't live your life trying to avoid pain, at the expense of en...",6
Céline,"  OK, you know what?   Those are words! I've gotta...I've gotta get away from you.   Stop the car, I want to get out!",6
Jesse,"No, no, no, don't...don't get out.",6
Céline,"You know, it's being around you...",6
Jesse,Keep talking...,6
Céline,"  Don't touch me!   You know, I wanna get on a cab...",6
Jesse,"  No, no, no, keep going...   No, listen, I'm just so happy...    Thank you, just keep going...  Alright. Look, I am just so happy, alright...to be with you. I am. I'm so glad you didn’t forget about me. OK.",6
Céline,"No, I didn't...and it pisses me off, OK? You come here to Paris, all romantic, and married, OK? Screw you! Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to get you or anything. I mean, all I need is married man! There's been so much water under the bridge, it's...it's not even about you anymore, it's about that time, that moment in time that is forever gone, I don't know!",6
Jesse,"You...you say all that, but you didn't even remember having sex. So...",6
Céline,  Of course I remembered.,6
Jesse,  You did?,6
Céline,Yes! Women pretend things like that. I don’t know,6
Jesse,  They do?,6
Céline,"Yeah, what was I supposed to say? That I remember the wine in the park and...us looking up at the stars fading away as the sun came up? We had sex TWICE  , you idiot!",6
Jesse,"Alright, you know what? I'm just...happy to see you, even if...you've become an angry, manic depressive activist. I still like you! I still enjoy being around you!",6
Céline,"And I feel the same.   I'm...I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. I just...I had to let it all out. I...",6
Jesse,Don't worry about it.,6
Céline,"I'm so miserable in my love life, in my relationship, I always act as... like...you know, I'm detached, but I'm... I'm dying inside. I'm dying because I'm so numb. I don't feel pain, or excitement. I'm not even bitter, I'm just...uh",6
Jesse,You think you're the one dying inside? My life is twenty four-seven...BAD.,6
Céline,I'm sorry.,6
Jesse,"No, no, no...I mean, the only happiness I get is when I'm out with my son. I've been to marriage counseling, I've done things I never thought I would have to do. I lit candles, bought self-help books, lingerie...",6
Céline,Did the candles help?,6
Jesse,"HELL. NO.   Alright, I don’t love her the way she needs to be loved, and...I don't even see a future for us. But then I look at...at my little boy, sitting at the table across from me, and I think I would suffer any torture to be with him for all the minutes of his life. You know, I don't wanna miss out on one. But then...there's no joy, or laughter, in my home. You know, and I don't want him growing up in that!",6
Céline,"Oh, no laughter? That's terrible. My parents have been together for 35 years and even when they have a bad fight they end up laughing like crazy.",6
Jesse,"I just...I don't wanna be one of those people who are...getting divorced at 52 and falling down into tears admitting that they never really loved their spouse, and they feel that their life has been   sucked up into a vacuum cleaner! You know, I want a great life. I want her to have a great life. She deserves that! Alright? But we're just living in a pretense of a marriage, responsibility and all these...just...ideas of how people are supposed to live. Then I...I have these dreams...",6
Céline,What dreams?,6
Jesse,"  I have these dreams, you know, that I’m I'm standing on a platform, and uh, you keep going by on a train, and...you go by, and you go by, and you go by, and you go by, and I wake up with the fucking sweats, you know? And then I have this other dream, oh...where you're...pregnant, in bed beside me, naked, and I want so badly to touch you, but you tell me not to and then you look away and...and I...I...I touch you anyway, right on your ankle and your skin is so soft and I wake up in sobs, alright?   And my wife is sitting there looking at me, and I feel like I'm a million miles from her, and I know that there's something...wrong!   You know, that I ca...that I can't keep living like this, that there's gotta be something more to love than commitment. But then I think that...I might have given up...on the whole idea of romantic love. That I...I might have put it to bed that...that day when you weren't there. You know, I think I might have done that.",6
Céline,  Why are you telling me all this?,6
Jesse,"I'm sorry. I don't know, I'm...I...I should...I...I shouldn't have.",6
Céline,"You know, it's so weird...that people think they are the only one going through tough times. I mean when I read the article I thought...your life was perfect. A wife, a kid, a published author.   Your personal life is more of a mess than mine! I'm sorry!",6
Jesse,Well...I'm glad it's good for something.,6
Céline,"  Oh, monsieur, c'est la! Rentrez dans la passe la.",6
Jesse,This is...this is...this is where you live?,7
Céline,Yeah.,7
Jesse,"So, uh, you're just relieved that I'm in even more deep shit than you are?",7
Céline,Yes. You've made me feel better.,7
Jesse,"Oh, good, I'm glad.",7
Céline,"No, I really wish you the best. It's not because I'm incapable of having a good relationship or a family that I wish everyone to be doomed like me.",7
Jesse,I'm sure you might make a great mom someday.,7
Céline,"Really, you think so?",7
Jesse,"Oh, yeah. A few anti-depressants...you know, you'll do great.",7
Céline,"Oh, no   OK say ""Stop""!",7
Jesse,"Um, ""Stop""!",7
Céline,  Ohhhh!!,7
Jesse,"Heey! OK, you ready?",7
Céline,So... I want to try something.,7
Jesse,What?,7
Céline,   I want to see if you stay together or if you dissolve into molecules.,7
Jesse,  How am I doing?,7
Céline,Still here.,7
Jesse,"Good, I like being here.   Is this your apartment?",7
Céline,"Oh, no, I live down there.",7
Jesse,Down there?,7
Céline,Yeah.,7
Jesse,"  Um, monsieur...I'm gonna walk her to her door. Uh",7
Céline,  Il va m'accompagner a la porte.,7
Jesse,This is incredible! This is where you live?,7
Céline,Yeah.,7
Jesse,How long have you been here?,7
Céline,Four years. So tell me...,7
Jesse,What?,7
Céline,"Is it all true, about your dreams, or...did you just say that to hopefully get in my pants?",7
Jesse,"Oh, I just said that to get into your pants! I use that all the time...",7
Céline,"Oh, OK. Does it work?",7
Jesse,"Eh, you know...sometimes.",7
Céline,"  Here is my kitty! Oh, so cute! Look at him. You know what I love about this cat? It's that...every morning, I bring him down to the courtyard, and every single morning he looks at everything like it was the first time! Every corner, every tree, every plant. He smells everything with his little cute nose. Oh, I love my kitty! I love my kitty!",7
Jesse,What's his name?,7
Céline,Che.,7
Jesse,  Che? Uh-huh.,7
Céline,What?,7
Jesse,Commie!,7
Céline,"No, ""Che"" in Argentina means ""Hey""!   Oh, baby! Oh, yes, yes, yes.",7
Céline,We're having a little party. It's so much fun!,7
Céline,Un taboulet! Je vais descendre en cinq minutes!,7
Jesse,  Uh...Salut!,7
Jesse,So...,7
Céline,So,7
Céline,"Non, il prend l'avion.",7
Jesse,You know what I...I was thinking um...would you play me one of your songs?,7
Céline,You're gonna miss your flight!,7
Jesse,"I won't, I won't! I’m gonna be sitting in the airport for over an hour, reading the newspaper, alright. Wishing you played me one of your songs.",7
Céline,One song?,7
Jesse,Yeah.,7
Céline,"OK, but quickly.",7
Jesse,OK.,7
Jesse,"God, I love these old staircases.",7
Céline,Hold this!,7
Jesse,"  Hey there, buddy! Che...",7
Céline,Would you like some tea?,7
Jesse,"Yeah, sure.",7
Céline,Is chamomile OK?,7
Jesse,Yeah. Great. Merci!,7
Céline,“Messy”? You think my apartment is messy?,7
Jesse,"No, no, no. Merci, merci...merci beaucoup.",7
Céline,"Ah, ""merci."" I meant to tell you. Your French has improved a lot.",7
Jesse,  Really?,7
Céline,"Yeah! Yeah, you've really mastered the language.",7
Jesse,"Alright, alright. What song are you gonna play me, huh?",7
Céline,"No, I...I can't. It's too embarrassing. It's been...",7
Jesse,"Whoa! No way, no way! I came all the way up here, you cannot crap out on me now. One song  , anything will be great.",7
Céline,"No, but listen, you're gonna laugh at me...",7
Jesse,You think so?,7
Céline,Yes!,7
Jesse,I doubt it.,7
Céline,"  OK. What do you want to hear? I have a...I have 3 songs in English. One's about my cat, one's about...my ex-boyfriend, well, ex-ex-boyfriend, and there’s one about   well...it's just a...little waltz.",7
Jesse,"A waltz? Yeah, play the waltz.",7
Céline,"I haven't played it in a while, you sure?   Alright, the waltz. OK",7
Céline,"Let me sing you, a waltz. Out of nowhere, out of my thoughts. Let me sing you, a waltz. About this one night stand. You were for me that night, Everything I always dreamt of in life.",7
Céline,But now you're gone. You are far gone. All the way to your island of rain.,7
Céline,"It was for you just a one night thing. But you were much more to me, Just so you know.",7
Céline,I don't care what they say I know what you meant for me that day.,7
Céline,I just wanted another try. I just wanted another night. Even if it doesn't seem quite right.,7
Céline,You meant for me much more Than anyone I've met before.,7
Céline,"One single night with you, little...Jesse... Is worth a thousand with any-body. I have no bitterness, my sweet. I'll never forget this one night thing. Even tomorrow in other arms. My heart will stay yours until I die.",7
Céline,"Let me sing you a waltz Out of nowhere, out of my blues. Let me sing you a waltz. About this lovely one night stand.",7
Jesse,"No, one more, one more. Please, please? C’mon. Please, please?",7
Céline,"No! No, no, no, no - it was our deal. One... one song! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!",7
Céline,"You can have your tea, and then ah...",7
Jesse,"  Alright, let me...Let me ask you one question. Do you just plug that name in for every guy that comes up here?",7
Céline,"Oh, yes, of course! What do you think, that I wrote this song about you? Are you nuts?",7
Jesse,"  Oh, is this you? Little cross-eyed Céline?",7
Céline,Yes. That’s funny,7
Jesse,Cute! Is that your grandmother?,7
Céline,Yeah.,7
Jesse,"Oh, wow.",7
Céline,You want some honey?,7
Jesse,"Yeah, sure.",7
Céline,  Did you ever see Nina Simone in concert?,7
Jesse,"No, I never did. I can't believe she's gone.",7
Céline,"I know, it's so sad!",7
Jesse,Thanks.,7
Céline,"It’s hot.   I saw her twice, in concert. She was so great!   That's one of my favorite songs of hers.",7
Jesse,  I know...,7
